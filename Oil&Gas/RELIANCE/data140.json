{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd. and its partner BP Plc are reviving investment plans for a gas block close to a military missile launching facility in the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance and its British partner are preparing a new development plan for the gas-rich NEC-OSN-97/2 block, also called NEC-25, in the Mahanadi basin offshore eastern India, according to Atanu Chakraborty, head of India\u2019s oil regulator Directorate General of Hydrocarbons.\u00a0Work in the block was hindered partly by objections from the defense ministry for its proximity to the Chandipur missile test base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are already in discussion with us on the technical aspects of their field development plan,\u201d Chakraborty said in an interview in London. \u201cReservoirs are being assessed, so that they make the final decision.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new proposal follows an earlier integrated field development plan submitted in March 2013. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has announced a slew of reforms, including the freedom to price and market natural gas, to push production from stalled projects as it aims to increase the fuel\u2019s share in India\u2019s energy mix to 15 percent by 2020 from 6.5 percent. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan expects investments of\u00a0$20 billion by as early as 2021 to raise India\u2019s gas output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance and BP recently resuscitated their partnership by announcing fresh investments of $6 billion in gas projects in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, which lies south of NEC-25. Indian\u2019s biggest explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp. also plans to spend $10 billion in deepwater projects off eastern India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance shares rose as much as 0.7 percent to 823.60 rupees before paring gains to trade at 819 rupees as of 2:52 p.m. in Mumbai on Friday. BP shares were trading 0.3 percent lower at 448.55 pence in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese investments are expected to boost India\u2019s gas production by more than two thirds\u00a0over the next five years, according to Chakraborty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will add 50-55 million cubic meters per day of gas production on a very conservative basis,\u201d he said. The country\u2019s current output is about 80 million cubic meters a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance and its Canadian partner Niko Resources Ltd. were awarded the NEC-25 block in 2000 and made eight gas discoveries before BP picked up a 30 percent stake in the block through a $7.2-billion deal with Reliance in 2011. That transaction included similar interests in 22 other blocks. Niko decided to exit in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment, while a BP India spokeswoman said the company intends to progress with the field development plan within the stipulated time frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you make a first move into a basin, it normally takes time,\u201d Chakraborty said. \u201cThe issues related to closeness to Chandipur missile area had to be adjusted and now the Mahanadi basin fields are maturing slowly towards development. We will see investments coming there sooner than later.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        BP, Reliance Close In on India Gas Field Near Missile Site\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-10 11:48:00"}
