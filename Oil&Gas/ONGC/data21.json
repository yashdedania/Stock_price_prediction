The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The share sale is expected to help the government exceed its record Rs 72,500 crore divestment target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the week, the finance ministry said it would cut back on the planned additional borrowing for the current fiscal year to Rs 20,000 crore from Rs 50,000 crore previously. Bond markets cheered the news with the benchmark 10-year yields on sovereign debt dropping 16 basis points, the sharpest fall in over a year.However, lower borrowing may still not be enough for the government to rein in its fiscal deficit within its targeted 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Nomura.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC-HPCL Deal Nullifies  Lower Government Borrowing, Tweets Chidambaram\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-21 07:10:00"}
