{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Oil & Natural Gas Corp. plans to sell its holding in two state-run energy companies within a year to repay debt it raised to fund the purchase of the Indian government\u2019s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state-run explorer may sell shares of Indian Oil Corp. and GAIL India Ltd. in multiple transactions on the open market through the year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. ONGC has already received the approval of the government and is waiting for the right price to begin offloading the shares, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sales can help ONGC return to its debt-free status, give it greater flexibility to acquire overseas oil and gas assets and invest in projects to boost output. ONGC holds 13.77 percent stake in Indian Oil,\u00a0the nation\u2019s biggest refiner, and 4.83 percent in its largest gas utility, GAIL. The holdings can fetch over $4.8 billion at current market rates, covering almost 90 percent of the loans taken by the New Delhi-based driller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC raised one-year bridge loans worth 350 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) from seven banks to partly fund the 369 billion-rupee purchase of the government\u2019s holding in HPCL. It tapped the debt market for the first time last month and can pay off its entire loan if it uses part of its\u00a0130 billion rupees of cash reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC rose as much as 3.3 percent and traded 2.9 percent higher at 190.80 rupees as of 2:55 p.m. in Mumbai on Wednesday. Indian Oil climbed as much as 2.2 percent to trade 0.9 percent higher at 405 rupees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ONGC spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday. Finance Ministry spokesman D.S. Malik wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will use our cash balance first and then liquid assets. Debt will be last,\u201d ONGC Chairman Shashi Shanker had said on Jan. 22, while announcing the HPCL deal that was completed on Jan. 31. \u201cWe will take a call on selling if the market is favorable, but we won\u2019t sell anything in distress.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92018 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC Is Said to Plan $4.8 Billion Indian Oil, GAIL Stake Sale\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-02-08 01:37:00"}
