{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Explorers in the world\u2019s fastest-growing oil market are seeking lower taxes on crude produced domestically to encourage fresh drilling as India tries to reduce its dependence on energy imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and the biggest private producer Cairn India Ltd. want Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to at least halve the tax on crude oil production in the federal budget due Feb. 1. India surprised some explorers last year with its 20 percent levy on crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGlobally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments,\u201d said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. \u201cIn India, the cess rate of 20 percent acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10 percent in the next five years. Reducing the levy will help explorers including ONGC and Cairn India, which Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan estimates will spend $25 billion by the end of this decade.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s hydrocarbon resources are highly undeveloped and production has been declining for the past several years, prompting the government to nudge companies to invest in reversing the fall and increase energy supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Delhi-based ONGC is spending over $5 billion for its biggest development plan in a deep-sea block in the Bay of Bengal off the country\u2019s east coast. Cairn India also plans to spend as much as $4 billion over the next few years to drill for oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia\u2019s third-largest economy meets about 80 percent of its crude oil requirements through imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need some money to be left behind so that we are able to flow back into the investment cycle,\u201d said A.K. Srinivasan, finance director at ONGC, the nation\u2019s biggest explorer. \u201cOtherwise there will be cash shortage. Already, we are going to run cash shortages.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a price of $55 a barrel, ONGC may have to pay about $11 as cess, compared with $9 when prices were $100 a barrel and the tax was fixed charge, he said. \u201cWith crude prices firming up, the cost impact of this tax is quite high.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrent oil prices have risen about 17 percent since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 agreed in November to cut production for six months starting in January. The fuel traded above $100 as recently as September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirming crude prices may also allow the government to reduce the levy on retail prices for gasoline and diesel, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia didn\u2019t pass on to consumers the entire benefit of crude\u2019s price decline from July 2014, increasing excise duty on the two fuels nine times and mopping up about 960 billion rupees ($14 billion) in the previous two fiscal years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo read on how Modi\u2019s cash ban is impacting oil demand, click here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government may now look at easing prices as one way of cushioning the impact of its Nov. 8 ban on high-denomination currency notes, which impacted the rural population the most, as it prepares for five state elections this quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe consumer price of diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, is at a record while that of gasoline is at the highest since August 2014, according to state-run fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp.\u2019s website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, taxes have come and we have not hidden it,\u201d Pradhan, the oil minister, said in New Delhi on Jan. 16. \u201cIf the prices start pinching the consumers, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Explorers in Oil Bright Spot Seek Tax Breaks to Spur Output\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-01-22 04:27:00"}
