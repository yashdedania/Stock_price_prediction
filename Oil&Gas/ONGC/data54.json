ONGC currently owns 71.63 percent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 percent stake in it.The official said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred toanother state-run firm and the ownership is not changing.The deal will be completed within a year, he said.
