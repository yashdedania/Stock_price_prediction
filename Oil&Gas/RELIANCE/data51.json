{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Fast Retailing Co., operator of the Uniqlo casual-wear brand, has applied to open stores in India as Asia\u2019s largest clothing chain increases its reliance on overseas markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Japanese company submitted an application on Nov. 21 seeking government approval to do business in the country under the Uniqlo brand name, according to a filing on India\u2019s Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIndia is a market with great potential,\u201d Pei-Chi Tung, a spokeswoman for Fast Retailing, said in an email. \u201cAt the moment, we are awaiting word from the government, and we will be able to discuss potential future steps at a later date.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Retailing, which recently forecast that international sales for its Uniqlo chain will exceed those in Japan this fiscal year for the first time, has been pushing to expand overseas as wages languish and the population ages at home. The brand\u2019s international store count surpassed the number of locations in Japan two years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has expressed an interest in entering India since at least 2011. The move would follow Inditex SA\u2019s Zara and Hennes & Mauritz AB in an apparel market that\u2019s forecast by Euromonitor International to grow 29 percent to 3.76 trillion rupees ($58 billion) by 2021. Inditex opened a flagship Zara shop in Mumbai in May, which has had a strong reception, Chief Executive Officer Pablo Isla said in September. It recently started online sales in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail chain operators in India are benefiting from a government push to cut cash payments that is prompting shoppers to increasingly use credit cards and digital payments services. Such store networks have an advantage -- in a country where per capita incomes have more than doubled in the past decade -- as most small mom-and-pop stores largely take cash payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Retailing last month reported the biggest jump in annual earnings in more than a decade, driven by a near doubling of operating profit at Uniqlo stores outside of Japan. The company, which got about 58 percent of its revenue from Japan in fiscal 2016, is hitting its stride in places like China and Southeast Asia.\u00a0Operating profit for the brand in China jumped 37 percent for the year ended Aug. 31, compared with a 6.4 percent slump in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Retailing was down 0.2 percent in morning trading in Tokyo on Friday, paring a 1.1 percent drop at the market\u2019s open. The shares have lost 3.1 percent this year, while the benchmark Topix index has rallied 17 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Uniqlo Owner Seeks to Enter India as It Builds Overseas Reliance\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-25 01:59:00"}
