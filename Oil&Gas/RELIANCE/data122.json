{"text": "\n\n\n\nThe Bombay High Court struck down the antitrust regulator\u2019s April order to probe Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.\u2019s allegations of cartelisation against its older rivals.It said the Competition Commission of India does not have the jurisdiction to order a probe when there is a sector-specific regulator\u2014in this case the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. \u201cThe Competition Act itself is not sufficient to decide and deal with the issues arising out of the provisions of the TRAI Act,\u201d the court said.Reliance Jio now has the option to appeal against the order or approach TRAI.The court appears to have taken an overly conservative view of the CCI\u2019s jurisdiction, said Samir Gandhi, partner at law firm AZB & Partners. \u201cThis might undermine the CCI\u2019s role as a market watchdog in many regulated sectors such as electricity, insurance and banking. This is contrary to the CCI\u2019s purpose\u2014which is to look at a given conduct through an antitrust lens, and not that of a sectoral regulator.\u201dOn the other hand, the ruling that any investigation by the CCI must only be commenced based on \u201crelevant\u201d evidence and that not all \u201cmajority decisions\u201d can be viewed as actions of a cartel would be quite correct, Gandhi said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November, Reliance Jio had filed a complaint alleging that the incumbents\u2014Bharti Airtel Ltd., Vodafone India Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd.\u2014were abusing their dominant position to prevent it from accessing points of interconnection. Such points connect users of one operator with subscribers of another mobile phone services provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: CCI Smells Anti-Competitive Behaviour By Vodafone, Idea And Airtel Against Reliance Jio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company representatives refused to comment on the high court verdict when contacted by BloombergQuint over the phone.The court order gives importance to a sectoral regulator by providing it an opportunity to identify the issues that companies in that space face before the CCI analyses the behaviour of a player, said Abir Roy, partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan. \u201cThe high court has recognised that the sectoral regulator should have the first right to determine how a player should function in the market.\u201dThe ruling comes after the telecom regulator on Tuesday reduced the interconnect charges paid by operators on cross-network calls by more than half to 6 paise a minute and decided to abolish them from 2020. Multiple brokerages, including Morgan Stanley, CLSA and Goldman Sachs, said Reliance Jio stands to gain as, being a smaller operator with free voice calls, it was a net payer of such charges. Its rivals like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular stand to lose revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Prevails Over Airtel As TRAI Cuts Call Connect Charges\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        High Court Strikes Down CCI\u2019s Cartelisation Probe In Reliance Jio Case\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-22 04:16:00"}
