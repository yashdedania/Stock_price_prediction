According to the indenture, the company had a seven-day grace period, after which an event of default would occur,\" Moody\u2019s said.Moody's said it withdrew the ratings as it considers a missed scheduled payment either of interest or principal as a \"default\".Earlier this month, RCom had said the company is not paying interest or principal amount for the time being to any lenders or its bondholders in view of the strategic debt restructuring scheme and debt standstill period till December 2018.The loss-making company, which has already announced shutting down of its 2G and 3G mobile telephony business by November 30, is saddled with Rs 44,300 crore debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: RCom Arm Sends Notice To Rivals For Campaign Against It\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Moody\u2019s Withdraws Reliance Communications\u2019 Corporate Family Rating Due To Default\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-18 07:05:00"}
