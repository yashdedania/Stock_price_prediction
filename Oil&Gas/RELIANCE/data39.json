{"text": "\n\n\n\nMukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.\u2019s listing could be a positive for Reliance Industries Ltd. as it would help in the price discovery of its digital offerings while potentially directing some cash to the parent company.That's what JPMorgan says would happen if India\u2019s newest telecom operator chooses to make its capital market debut. Ambani is weighing an initial public offering of Reliance Jio as soon as late 2018 or early 2019. Jio, which hasn\u2019t made a profit since its official launch last year, is aiming to improve its financial performance before any share sale, people with the knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg, asking not to be identified because the information is private.Investors value Jio primarily as a traditional telecom company, however, its product offerings span across the digital chain including mobile, broadband, entertainment and ecommerce, JPMorgan said in a report. These offerings could potentially be \u201cbetter valued\u201d if Jio were to be separately listed, it added.Measuring the telecom operators\u2019 performance based on key parameters such as subscriber addition, steady increase in tariffs and a positive operational profit in the first quarter of commercial operations, JPMorgan expects Jio to report a profit in the third quarter of the current financial year \u201cahead of schedule\u201d.In the September-ended quarter, Jio\u2019s average revenue per user stood at Rs 156.4. That compares with Rs 154 blended ARPU reported by Bharti Airtel Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the consolidated level, RIL\u2019s net debt has increased materially as spending in core projects coincided with capital expenditure for Reliance Jio. While the core projects should start delivering strong operating profit, a Jio listing should \u201cpotentially upstream some cash to parent RIL\u201d, where it has invested over Rs 2 lakh crore, the brokerage said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther HighlightsJio is tracking ahead of forecasts in terms of subscriber additions, EBITDA margins and profit breakeven.It has delivered on all targets so far; next is diversifying the revenue base.Jio is expected to be the key driver for RIL stock price in CY18 as well.The company\u2019s EBITDA will increase from Rs 24,000 crore in financial year 2019-20 to Rs 36,700 in financial year 2021-22.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Why JPMorgan Says Jio\u2019s Listing Will Be Positive For Reliance\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-12-13 09:42:00"}
