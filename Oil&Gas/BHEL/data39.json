{"text": "\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s equity benchmarks have given the highest returns compared to peers from large economies since the Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse triggered a global meltdown nine years ago. And investors would have been better off betting on individual stocks rather than the Nifty 50 Index during the period.At least, that\u2019s what a BloombergQuint analysis shows. The Nifty 50 rose 3.4 times since Dec. 31, 2008. Had an investor parked Rs 50,000 in Nifty and Rs 1,000 each in the 50 index constituents then, the combined investment in the stocks would have fetched 24 percent higher returns than the benchmark gauge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, it\u2019s not as smooth as it appears. Only 24 stocks outperformed the index. The remaining 26 lagged, with 10 giving negative returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Stock Investments Beat Index Returns In The Last Decade\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-27 08:59:00"}
