{"text": "\n\n\n\nIncumbent telecom operators in India may see a drop in their revenue market share, once the newest entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. starts reporting its revenue numbers in the coming quarters, according to a Credit Suisse report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Jio starts reporting revenues, we should see a sharp drop in market shares for all operators as we believe Jio already has 8-10 percent market share.\n\nCredit Suisse Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio, which started operations in September last year, is yet to report its revenue as the company has been capitalising its expenses. However, Reliance Industries Ltd., the holding company of Reliance Jio, said that they would start recognising Jio\u2019s expenses from second quarter of the financial year 2017-18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top three telecom operators: Bharti Airtel Ltd., Vodafone India Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd., hold close to 80 percent of the market, with Bharti Airtel having the highest revenue market share.Reliance Jio has gained market share from all the telecom operators. In fact, analysis of the adjusted gross revenue data also suggest that Bharti Airtel could have lost more market share compared to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio has seen a 50 basis points increase in subscriber base every quarter since its launch, the Credit Suisse report said. With the launch of the 4G feature phone, its subscriber base is expected to increase. JioPhone will allow the operator to service 50 crore feature-phone subscribers in India. Deutsche Bank expects 10 crore subscribers to find the JioPhone proposition attractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Turbulence Caused By Reliance Jio Comes To An End, Says Deutsche Bank\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Jio Has 8-10% Revenue Market Share, Says Credit Suisse\u00a0\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-08-31 06:30:00"}
