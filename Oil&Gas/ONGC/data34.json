That\u2019s not the case. It was announced by the finance minister in the Budget and then they consulted us on what we want. We chose HPCL after considering all the pros and cons. We are confident that we\u2019ll be completing the deal before March end.\u201d But he declined to quantify the payout to shareholders, saying that is still under evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplaining why they chose HPCL over BPCL, he said, \u201cWe have around 15 million tonnes refinery in Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemcials, but we have no retail presence, while HCPL has huge retail presence with over 14,400 outlets, but does not have enough refining capacity. So there is a perfect business sense in choosing HCPL.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Will Eventually Look At HPCL-MRPL Merger, ONGC Chairman Says\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ONGC chief declined to comment on the reported government move to monetise up to 60 percent of the oil and gas fields developed by it along with Oil India Ltd. to private parties, saying the company has not heard anything from the government.The move comes as the oil ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms will help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.It hopes that the move may boost domestic output and help meet the Prime Minister's target of reducing fossil fuel imports by 10 percent by 2022. Currently, India is the world's third-largest crude importer and buys up to 80 percent of its supplies from overseas.After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and the Bassein gas fields in 1976, oil and gas behemoth ONGC has not been able to bring in any new major fields into production in the last three decades. India has failed to draw in global oil majors since 1990 despite easing fiscal terms. The only exceptions are Royal Dutch Shell and BP which bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC Aims To Complete HPCL Acquisition By March\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-11 02:18:00"}
