{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Oil & Natural Gas Corp.\u2019s quarterly profits missed estimates for a gain as\u00a0lower gas revenues and a jump in royalty payments\u00a0outweighed the boost from higher crude prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income at India\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer fell\u00a06.1 percent to 43.4 billion rupees ($673.6 million) in the three months ended March, the company said in a statement Friday. That\u2019s below all but two of the 23 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which\u00a0averaged 50.7 billion rupees. Sales grew 34 percent to 217.14 billion rupees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC,\u00a0which is key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s plan to cut India\u2019s oil import dependence by 10 percent over the next five years, is seeking to raise output through exploration and acquisitions while preparing\u00a0for the government\u2019s plan to\u00a0consolidate state oil companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses last quarter rose almost 48 percent to 207 billion rupees, including royalty payments of 24.4 billion rupees to the states of Assam and Gujarat. The jump in costs and drop in profit were partly attributable to the royalty issue, according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe royalty issue is behind us and we don\u2019t expect any further charge on that,\u201d Chairman Dinesh Kumar Sarraf told reporters Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses also rose as the company made higher provisions for employees\u2019 salaries, which increased from Jan. 1,\u00a0according to Emkay\u2019s Joshi. Shares in Mumbai fell as much as 2.6 percent to 171.20 rupees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC produced 6.4 million tons of crude in January-March, 0.8 percent more than a year ago, while\u00a0natural gas output rose 13 percent to 5.94 billion cubic meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnprofitable Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company earned an average $54.91 on every barrel of oil sold last quarter, compared with $34.88\u00a0during the same period a year ago.\u00a0Meanwhile, the price of gas produced in India was fixed at $2.50 per million British thermal units for the six months to March, about a third lower than a year earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe gas business is no longer profitable for us,\u201d\u00a0Sarraf said. \u201dOur cost of production is significantly higher than the current price.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of gas, which the government sets every six months, has been pegged at $2.48 per million Btu until September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC will maintain capital expenditure in the current fiscal year at around 300 billion rupees and drill about 500 wells, similar to what the company did the previous year, Sarraf said. It declared a final dividend of 0.8 rupees, adding to the 6.75 rupees already paid in two tranches during the year.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC Posts Surprise Profit Drop on Royalties, Weak Gas Price\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-05-30 02:58:00"}
