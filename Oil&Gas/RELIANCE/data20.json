{"text": "\n\n\n\nThe last few months have seen a bitter battle in the telecom industry with the entry of the Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. In December last year, Ambani announced the extension of Jio\u2019s free services till March 31, after providing 90 days of promotional offers since the the launch last September.Chairman of Bharti Enterprises, Sunil Bharti Mittal, says the entry of a new player was bound to cause some degree of disruption, especially given the scale of investment and size of Reliance Jio's parent. Accordingly, he had expected promotional offers to last 30-60 days, but not seven months. Mittal was speaking to BloombergQuint\u2019s Menaka Doshi on the sidelines of the 47th World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expected voice to be thrown in for free since it was being talked about for a long period of time. You can sample it for 30-60 days, but to do it free for seven months. Clearly they haven\u2019t got the attention they wanted and they haven\u2019t been able to stabilise their network.\u00a0Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chairman, Bharti Enterprises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Davos 2017: Sunil Mittal Says A Decision On Bharti Infratel Stake Sale Will Be Taken In A Month\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Davos 2017: Reliance Jio Will Be A Major Player But Not The Only One, Says Sunil Mittal\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-22 05:16:00"}
