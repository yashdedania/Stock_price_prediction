This is expected to rise to double digits as data usage grows and as Jio adds more content to its 4G services, Das added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything more than the tip of the iceberg.Sandeep Das, Former CEO And MD, Reliance Jio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio began charging users from April after disrupting the industry with six months of free services. It still offers cheaper plans, forcing rivals to cut tariffs. As competition rose, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular Ltd. agreed to merge. Bharti Airtel too will take over Tata Group\u2019s mobile services business, after acquiring Telenor\u2019s India operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mukesh Ambani-led company has been gaining users, largely at the expense of smaller rivals. It added 1.53 crore new subscribers in the three months to September, taking its user base to 13.86 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio\u2019s results are \u201cincredible\u201d news for the telecom industry, according to Rajan Mathews, chairman of the industry lobby Cellular Operators Association of India. If more data usage can push the ARPU to Rs 200 a month, \u201cthen it\u2019s good for the health of the industry as other operators too can start pushing up\u201d their tariffs, Mathews told BloombergQuint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that Reliance Jio has set a benchmark, which incumbent operators will have to match, and in turn will benefit customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio has set the pace, rest of the competition is trying to quickly catch up.\u00a0Rajan Mathews, Chairman, COAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio\u2019s \u201ccut-throat pricing\u201d and free services have ended up developing the data market, said Mahesh Uppal, telecom analyst and director of ComFirst India. The average data consumption, which was less than one gigabyte just a year ago, has now gone up to 9 GB in Jio\u2019s case, he pointed out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio reported a loss of Rs 271 crore on a standalone revenue at Rs 6,147 crore for the three months ended September. The company\u2019s revenue market share, which has already increased significantly, is expected to go higher, according to Mayuresh Joshi, fund manager at Angel Broking. \"If they\u2019re able to expand RMS, you will see a gradual uptick in the margins,\" Joshi told BloombergQuint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the full discussion here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Corrects an earlier version to state that it\u2019s the company\u2019s first quarter of commercial operations in the headline and the first paragraph)\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        It Took Reliance Jio Three Months Of Commercial Operations To Turn In An Operating Profit\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-24 04:02:00"}
