{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s richest man is weighing an initial public offering of mobile operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said, after a $31 billion investment spree that roiled the country\u2019s wireless market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Industries Ltd., the conglomerate backed by tycoon\u00a0Mukesh Ambani, is holding internal discussions about\u00a0preparing to list Jio as soon as late 2018 or early 2019, according to the people.\u00a0Jio, which hasn\u2019t made a profit since its official launch last year, is targeting to improve its financial performance before any share sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Jio listing would cap a triumphant return to the Indian wireless market for Ambani, 60, more than a decade after a family feud that led him to cede control of a previous telecom venture to his younger brother. Jio, which is wholly owned by Reliance Industries, launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world\u2019s most crowded mobile markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt should get reflected in the current market price level for Reliance,\u201d Deven Choksey,\u00a0managing director of K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt, told Bloomberg Quint on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio may achieve a market capitalization of around 500 billion rupees ($7.8 billion) to 700 billion rupees through an IPO, according to Arun Kejriwal, founder of advisory firm\u00a0Kejriwal\u00a0Research & Investment Services Pvt. That valuation assumes the company will be able to reach annual revenue of about\u00a0250 billion rupees by the time it lists, Kejriwal said by phone Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBharti Airtel Ltd. this year agreed to absorb Tata Group\u2019s mobile-phone business, while Vodafone Group Plc and Idea Cellular Ltd. announced they would merge their local operations to create the nation\u2019s largest wireless operator. Despite being the newest entrant, Jio has accumulated more than 138.6 million subscribers, making it the fourth-largest operator at the end of September, according to data from the telecom regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeliberations about a Jio listing are at an early stage, and there\u2019s no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said.\u00a0A Reliance spokesman said on Tuesday the company does not \u201ccomment on media speculation and rumours.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see how one family is roiling India\u2019s phone industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio reported a net loss of 2.71 billion rupees ($42 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, though the business made a profit before interest and taxes over the period.\u00a0The wireless operator is \u201cahead of our schedule in terms of the returns\u201d generated, Ambani said at a Dec. 1 event in New Delhi. Jio is also planning further market share gains: the company is selling a $23 handset that offers 4G data plans that cost as low as 23 rupees for two days or 153 rupees monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbani has a net worth of nearly $40 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Shares of Reliance Industries, whose operations span refining to retail, have jumped 69 percent this year to give the company a market value of about $92 billion.\u00a0India\u2019s stock benchmark index, the S&P BSE Sensex, rose 25 percent over the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benchmark index\u00a0in India is trading near an all-time high, which has helped fuel a record IPO haul in the country. First-time share sales in the country have raised 750 billion rupees ($11.6 billion) this year, more than double the previous record set in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaire\u00a0Sunil Mittal, who controls the country\u2019s No. 1 wireless operator Bharti Airtel, warned last month the price war in the Indian market could continue through the first half of 2018. The Indian government is working on a new policy to encourage capital spending and restore the financial health of mobile-phone operators\u00a0battered\u00a0by bruising competition, telecom secretary\u00a0Aruna Sundararajan said in a November interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Said to Mull Wireless IPO After $31 Billion Spree\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-12-19 12:01:00"}
