{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer will pay as much as $1.2 billion to buy a majority stake in a gas field off the country\u2019s east coast, aiming to boost production as the country seeks to cut energy imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd.\u2019s board approved the purchase of an 80 percent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.\u2019s deepwater block\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Krishna Godavari basin, it said in a statement on Friday. The New Delhi-based company will pay $995.26 million for the Deen Dayal West Field, the largest discovery in the\u00a0KG-OSN-2001/3 block, with estimated natural gas reserves of 1.1 trillion cubic feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will pay\u200b another $200 million for six other discoveries\u00a0in the block located in the\u00a0Bay of Bengal. The block has likely total reserves of at least 11.2 trillion cubic feet, according to GSPC\u2019s annual report for the year ended March 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe acquisition fits well with the strategy of ONGC to enhance natural gas production from domestic fields on a faster pace,\u201d the company said, adding that trial gas production from Deen Dayal West Field has already started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal will help expedite production of gas from the block critical to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal of reducing import dependency of hydrocarbons by 10 percent by 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe companies will share infrastructure and reduce costs in an area where both have spent or plan to spend at least $3 billion each. The deal is critical for GSPC, a company owned by the government of the western state of Gujarat, as it is at least four years behind schedule in starting commercial gas production despite having completed construction of a processing platform, gas pipeline and an onshore terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC\u00a0said the acquisition will help it develop faster its discoveries in the Yanam and Godavari areas as well as gas discoveries in its KG-DWN-98/2 block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India\u2019s Top Oil Producer Spends $1.2 Billion to Buy Gas Block\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-12-27 01:27:00"}
