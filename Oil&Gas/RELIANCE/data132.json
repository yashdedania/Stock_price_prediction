From January 1, 2020, the charges will stand abolished.Rajan Mathews, director-general of Cellular Operators Association of India, said the incumbent operators will challenge the decision in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is quite a disastrous move for the majority of our members. And they have indicated that they will be moving court. By the way, the previous IUC order is also in the high court. So very sure this particular dramatic reduction in IUC charges will definitely end up in the court for adjudication.\u00a0Rajan Mathews, Director General, COAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Telecom Experts Rue TRAI\u2019s \u2018Nail In The Coffin\u2019 Move\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vodafone India is considering its options in response to TRAI\u2019s \u201cdisappointing\u201d decision, a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis is yet another retrograde regulatory measure that, unless mitigated, will have serious consequences for investment in rural coverage,\u201d the statement added. An operator pays IUC whenever a rival provides access to its network to complete a call. Larger players like Bharti Airtel, with deeper rural networks and premium pricing, typically see significantly higher traffic of incoming calls than outgoing, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities in July. Which means, they are the net earners of interconnect charges. An aggressive player like Reliance Jio, with free voice calling, is a net payer, a reason why it wanted them abolished.The reduced charges will \u201copen up worrying pricing flexibility\u201d for Reliance Jio after it triggered a tariff war by offering free services for six months to March, according to a JPMorgan report highlighting the challenges the industry could face. If interconnect costs are halved, it will add Rs 27-30 average revenue per user for Jio, the bank wrote.Sanjay Kapur, former chief executive officer of Bharti Airtel, told BloomberQuint that the lower IUC may cause some disruption or stress to older operators but will begin to nullify as the new operators gain share of call traffic.The regulator\u2019s decision follows a consultation paper it floated in 2015. Older operators like had demanded an increase in such charges. Bharti Airtel argued that Reliance Jio\u2019s push to abolish the charges would \u201ckill the industry\u201d and cost telecom operators nearly Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelecom Industry Reacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncumbent Players Will Move Court: COAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAI\u2019s Decision Pre-Meditated And Not Impartial: Sanjeev Aga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTricky Balancing Act: Rahul Khullar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Why Ambani, Mittal Are Squabbling Over IUC And MTR: BQ Explains\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Jio Prevails Over Airtel As TRAI Cuts Call Connect Charges\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-19 05:58:00"}
