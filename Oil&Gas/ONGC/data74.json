{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Cabinet is likely to consider on Wednesday the sale of government's 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. (ONGC) for over Rs 28,000 crore, a person with knowledge of the matter said.The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance, has moved the proposal for consideration of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), the person said on condition of anonymity.The government plans to divest its entire 51.11 percent shareholding in India's third-biggest fuel retailer HPCL to oil producer ONGC. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioned this during the 2017-18 Budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPCL will however not be merged with ONGC. It will remain a separate entity and operate as ONGC\u2019s subsidiary. As part of the transaction, HPCL may takeover operations of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, the person said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC currently owns 71.63 percent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 percent stake.It makes better sense for ONGC to consolidate all the refining operations in one unit, the person said.MRPL will be the third refinery of HPCL, which already has units at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.After the Cabinet nod, the government will move to appoint valuation and transaction advisers while ONGC too may decide to hire merchant bankers to arrive at the valuation of government shareholding. The transaction is likely to be completed within this fiscal year, another person familiar with the development said.ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL) \u2013 the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies. It found the nation's second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry, which relayed it to DIPAM.ONGC has cash reserves of Rs 13,014 crore and to fund the government stake acquisition in HPCL, it will have to borrow at least Rs 10,000 crore, the source said. BPCL has a market cap of Rs 1,01,622.07 crore and buying government's 54.93 percent would alone have entailed an outgo of Rs 55,821 crore.HPCL on the other hand has a market cap of Rs 56,162.88 and buying government's entire 51.11 per cent stake would entail an outgo of Rs 28,700 crore. Another Rs 14,600 crore or so would be required in case open offer for an additional 26 percent has to be made.The government was initially looking at creating an integrated oil company through merger of an oil producer with a refiner but the idea was dropped for the fear of repeating the Air India-Indian Airlines kind of a merger which is not considered successful, both people quoted above said.Similar differences in work culture and ethos prevail in upstream and downstream firms and so the exercise under consideration now is to only help government mop up resources and HPCL would become a mere subsidiary of ONGC.There are only six major companies in the oil sector \u2013 ONGC and Oil India Ltd being the oil producers, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), HPCL and BPCL in refinery business and GAIL in midstream gas transportation business.The rest, such as ONGC Videsh, Chennai Petroleum Corp (CPCL), Numaligarh Refinery Ltd and MRPL, are already subsidiaries of one of these six PSUs.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Cabinet May Decide On HPCL Stake Sale To ONGC Today\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-07-19 01:00:00"}
