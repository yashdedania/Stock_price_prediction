{"text": "\n\n\n\nReliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the telecommunications business of Mukesh Ambani - led Reliance Industries Ltd. pulled a surprise by turning in an operating profit within just three months of its commercial launch.Jio reported higher than expected revenue based on subscription recharges and lower than expected operational cost in its July - September 2017 quarterly earnings.Net revenue: Rs 6,147 croreEBIT: Rs 260 croreNet loss: Rs 271 croreReliance Jio started operations in December 2016 but pegged its commercial launch to \u201cquality of service\u201d conditions and has hence reported the July to September 2017 period as its first commercial quarter.The business beat analysts\u2019 expectations of continuing losses on the basis of 3 important factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Higher Than Anticipated Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio reported an average revenue per user of Rs 156, so far the highest amongst its competitors.The key revenue contributors wereRecharges done in the July - September 2017 period.Prime membership revenue proportionate to the quarter.Subscription recharges done in April, accounted for in July.This resulted in Jio reporting revenue from the earlier quarter in Q2. Because subscribers who paid for promotional plans \u2018Summer Surprise\u2019 and \u2018Dhan Dhana Dhan\u2019 were provided free services for the first three months starting April, effectively making the fourth month, i.e., July chargeable.This was emphasised in an earlier statement by the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery JIO PRIME member \u2013 when they make their first paid recharge prior to 15th April using Jio\u2019s Rs 303 plan (or any higher value plan) \u2013 will get services for the INITIAL 3\nMONTHS  on a complimentary basis. Your paid tariff plan will be applied only in July, after the expiry of the complimentary service.Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries (Statement on March 31, 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrokerages have acknowledged the company booked revenue from the earlier quarter.Reliance Jio \u201cdid benefit from some revenue booking of Q1 which helped push up the ARPU,\u201d said a note by JP Morgan\u2019s Asia Pacific Equity Research team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur calculations suggest Jio\u2019s realisable ARPU for Q2FY18 must have been around Rs 121/month, instead of the reported amount of Rs 156/month, including Rs 8 for IUC, Rs 107 pertaining to recharges and\u00a0 Rs 7 for prime planKotak Securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of active subscribers at 13.1 crore (131 million) versus 13.86 crore (138.6 million) total subscribers also surprised the street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a bigger\nnumber than most estimates which were based on reported VLR (active subscribers) data\nwhich suggested 100 million. Jio explained that as many of its subs are pure data\nusers who may use it only few days in a week they do not feature in\nVLR methodology but are still paying for services.\u00a0CLSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Capitalisation Of Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CLSA note said employee and other expenses came in lower than anticipated and may have been capitalised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were expecting a run rate of Rs 8 billion\nversus reported opex of Rs 3 billion, we estimate that ~Rs 5 billion may have been\ncapitalised from employee costs.CLSA (on employee costs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kotak Securities note said \u201cThe management indicated that a part of network costs and employee costs, related to non-wireless business were capitalized\u201d.The company also reported lower average tower rent costs due to self-owned towers and on the back of power and fuel efficiency. Analyst reports indicated that on average Jio paid a rent of Rs 13,000 per month versus the average industry rent of Rs 31,000 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRJIO\u2019s\noperating cost surprised positively with unit\nnetwork cost 49 percent lower than Idea\u2019s in Q1FY18 due to lower tower rentals and significantly\nlower subscriber acquisition cost riding its digital onboarding. We now estimate\nEBITDA breakeven in FY18 and have revised up FY19E EBITDA 144 percent to Rs 210 billion, assuming 9 percent higher subscribers, 5 percent higher\nARPU and 43 percent  EBITDA margin.\n\nEdelweiss Securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Reliance jio stands to benefit from a further lowering of costs starting Q3 as interconnect charges have been slashed to less than half, from 14 paise to 6 paise, by telecom regulator TRAI.In Q2 Jio reported a close to Rs 2,200 crore interconnect cost. That will decline by half starting Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. 50% Lower Depreciation Rate Than Competitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bigger impact on costs was due to a lower than anticipated depreciation charge.Reliance Jio has chosen a depreciation method different from that of its key competitors. It charged depreciation on assets based on a unit-of-production method, also understood as a usage-based method. In this, depreciation is calculated as per asset capacity utilised. Other telecom service providers such as industry leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd. charge depreciation on a straight-line method basis.This led to a depreciation rate of 3.25 percent on capitalised assets of just over Rs 1,45,000 crore versus the 7-8 percent rate accounted by other telecom companies, said the Kotak Securities note.JP Morgan calculated Jio\u2019s depreciation rate at 2 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso no depreciation was charged on assets worth Rs 62,000 crore belonging to the wireline business segment, said the CLSA note. These have not been capitalised as they are yet to start commercial operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Rs 1.45 trillion (Rs 1,45,000 crore) capitalised, Reliance has opted for unit of production\nmethod of depreciation rather than the typical Straight Line Method methodology for\ndepreciating electronics and spectrum which will form a big chunk of this\namount. Therefore, Reliance\u2019s depreciation in earlier years will be lower when\nactual network utilisation and throughput is much lower as compared to later\nyears when the network hits appropriate utilisation.CLSA\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        How Reliance Jio Ended Up With Less Red In Q2\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-16 12:42:00"}
