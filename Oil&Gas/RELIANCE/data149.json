{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s Blackmores Ltd., which has relied on the Chinese personal shoppers known as daigou for access to consumers in Asia\u2019s largest economy, is breaking free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vitamin maker said this week it\u2019s now getting half of its mainland revenue from selling straight to consumers there, helped by a China export unit started just over a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sydney-based company\u2019s shares have lost about half their value since early 2016 as China moved to tighten scrutiny of the imported food supplement, disrupting the daigou grey-market business model. Blackmores\u2019 fortunes could be turning, with the stock rising 19 percent since its results were released pre-market Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s \u201call about the Asian growth story,\u201d says Chris Kallos, an analyst in Sydney at Morningstar Australasia Pty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t expect the daigou to disappear though. New Zealand\u2019s a2 Milk Co. says they remain a \u201ckey focus\u201d even as it sells more of its infant formula to Chinese consumers online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Blackmores Cuts Reliance on China's Daigou Grey Market\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-01 09:17:00"}
