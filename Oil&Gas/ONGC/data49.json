{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s largest explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. is the only stock on the Nifty 50 index that has over 25 \u2018buy\u2019 ratings and zero \u2018sell\u2019 rating. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg either recommend a \u2018buy\u2019 or \u2018hold\u2019 on the state-run company, a big shift from the beginning of the year.Here are some of the factors that may have worked in ONGC\u2019s favour:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has changed for ONGC:Higher Crude PricesBrent crude, the Asian benchmark, is trading more than $57 per barrel \u2013 more than two-year high \u2013 driven by growing demand, and a threat to Iraq\u2019s crude exports as it holds a referendum on independence.The sustained crude oil rise will likely benefit ONGC, boosting its realisations. Jefferies in its report expects the explorer\u2019s earnings per share to rise by 3.2 percent for every $1-per-barrel increase in crude.Improvement In GasThe government's new gas pricing rule saw rates dropping by more than half to $2.48 per million British thermal unit had hurt ONGC. The gas business is no more profitable, Dinesh Saraf, ONGC\u2019s former chairman and managing director, had said at last quarter\u2019s earnings media conference.The price, however, is expected to change from October 1, say multiple brokerages. The government revises gas prices every six months and the next revision is likely to lift gas price to $3 per one million British Thermal Units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDying HPCL OverhangBuying government\u2019s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. at a higher valuation was one overhang on ONGC as the deal would have pushed up its debt. That may not be the case now as ONGC is expected to buy HPCL at the prevailing market price.ONGC will buy the government\u2019s stake in HPCL through bulk deals at the prevailing market prices in the next three months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC could rally sharply if there is clarity on the amount to be paid for the HPCL stake not being higher than the market price of HPCL.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Report On India Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJefferies in its recent report expected the ONGC-HPCL deal to be earnings-per-share accretive for the explorer with no significant impact on its balance sheet.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Why Analysts Are Turning Bullish On ONGC\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-28 03:20:00"}
