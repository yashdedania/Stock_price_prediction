The Centre will make the payout on behalf of the two companies.A bench presided by Justices J Chelameswar and S Abdul Nazeer recorded the statement of agreement.The apex court had on Monday disposed of a similar case between ONGC and the Gujarat government involving a royalty payment of Rs 8,392 crore, after the Centre agreed to foot the bill.The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act of 1948 mandates oil producers to pay 20 percent of the market value of crude they extract as royalty to the state where oil blocks are located.The Centre had said in 2003 that the burden of lower recovery because of subsidy offered on diesel, kerosene and LPG to consumers be shared by all the stakeholders and not oil marketing companies (OMCs) alone. It directed upstream companies, including ONGC, to sell crude to the OMCs at a discounted rate.From 2008, ONGC started paying royalty to state governments on the net or actual price realised from refiners after factoring in fuel subsidy discounts, leading to a dispute.In 2013, the Gujarat high court had directed ONGC to pay royalty to the state on the gross bill price of crude.The Supreme Court later directed ONGC to pay royalty to Gujarat at a pre-discount rate on February 1, 2014.
