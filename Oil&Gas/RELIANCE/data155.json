{"text": "\n\n\n\nConsolidation and \u201cturbulent times\u201d triggered by the launch of Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. are over, Deutsche Bank Markets Research said.The telecom sector\u2019s revenue is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.4 percent till the year to March 2021, driven by a 3.5 percent subscriber growth and 4 percent increase in average revenue per user. Three telecom companies \u2013 Bharti Airtel Ltd., Idea Cellular-Vodafone India combine and Reliance Jio \u2013 are expected to account for more than 90 percent of the revenue market share by then, it said in a report.Reliance Jio had triggered a tariff war by offering free voice and data for the first six months of its operations that began in September last year. The resultant competition saw Bharti Airtel acquire Telenor\u2019s India business and 4G business of Tikona Networks. Vodafone India and Idea Cellular also decided to merge to create India\u2019s largest telecom operator. Reliance Jio\u2019s decision to start charging for its services from April has brought relief to its older rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how Deutsche Bank expects the sector and top carriers to fare over the next three years.Telecom SectorInter-connect usage charges that operators pay each other for cross-network calls are expected to come down from 14 paise per minute 10 paise. This could hurt the earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 2-4 percent for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, according to Deutsche Bank. Normalisation of tariffs between Jio and other incumbents would help minimise the traffic asymmetry, it said.The government is also likely to increase the deferred spectrum payment tenor to 16 years from 10. This would essentially lead to a lower annual instalment and better cash flows in the medium term. Among the current top three players, Idea Cellular will benefit the most as spectrum payments account for 72 percent of its EBITDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBharti AirtelWith expected 35 percent revenue market share, Bharti Airtel remains Deutsche Bank\u2019s top pick. It upgraded Bharti Airtel\u2019s target price by 20 percent to Rs 480 on the back of normalisation of Reliance Jio\u2019s pricing, the ongoing turnaround in African operations and an expected improvement in return ratios.Idea CellularIdea Cellular, along with Vodafone India Ltd., will have a market share of 35 percent and is expected to see its revenue grow at a CAGR of 10.5 percent. Merger with Vodafone India would lead to an annual savings of close to Rs 3,000 crore, largely through rationalisation of sites and lower subscriber acquisition costs. Idea has also committed to selling its stake in Indus Towers to bring down the debt of the merged company.Reliance JioWith a total investment of more than Rs 2 lakh crore, Reliance Jio is expected to have a market share of 25 percent by March 2021. Its newly launched JioPhone will allow the operator to service 50 crore feature-phone subscribers in India and drive adoption of 4G data, Deutsche Bank said. It expects that 10 crore subscribers could find the JioPhone proposition attractive.The impact on rivals would be limited because of Rs 153 a month price of the plan, a three-year lock-in and availability of handsets at Rs 2,000-2,500 in the market.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Turbulence Caused By Reliance Jio Comes To An End, Says Deutsche Bank\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-08-29 03:36:00"}
