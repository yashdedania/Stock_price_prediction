The gas fields, which could fetch as much as $2 billion, have also drawn interest from Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bangladeshi government has also expressed interest in taking over Chevron\u2019s holdings, according to the people.\u00a0No final agreement has been reached with any party, the people said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy companies have announced $43.2 billion of asset sales this year after crude prices fell to the lowest level in more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\u00a0Chevron, the largest U.S. oil producer after Exxon Mobil Corp., is seeking buyers for Asian geothermal assets that could fetch as much as $3 billion and is also holding talks to sell other assets in Indonesia and Thailand, people familiar with the matter said earlier.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSeveral large global oil companies are selling assets, probably because they are facing a cash crunch at the parent level following the sharp fall in oil and gas prices,\u201d Sachin Mehta, a Mumbai-based analyst at Centrum Broking Ltd., said by phone Friday.
