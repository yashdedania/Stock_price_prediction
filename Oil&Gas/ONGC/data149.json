{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nIn a bonanza to oil producing states like Assam, the government has ordered state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. and Oil India Ltd. to pay royalty to them on the gross price for crude oil and not the net rate they actually realise.As per government mandate, ONGC and Oil India offer discounts on crude oil to make up for a part of the losses refiners suffer on selling cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene at government controlled rates. These discounts also covered diesel till October 2014 when the price of the fuel was deregulated. \nSo in effect, ONGC/OIL would raise a gross bill based on the prevailing international oil price but its actual realisation was less than that after accounting for the subsidy discount. However, producing states felt ONGC and Oil India need to pay royalty on gross billing. The Gujarat High Court in November 2013 ruled in favour of the state government and ONGC was asked to pay about Rs 10,000 crore in past royalty dues.This prompted other oil producing states, particularly Assam, to demand a similar treatment. Till the time Congress ruled Assam, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan maintained that the state government will have to approach the judiciary to get similar relief. \nNow with a BJP government coming to power in the state, his ministry last week issued orders asking ONGC and Oil India to pay royalty at pre-discount rates effective February 1, 2014. \n\u201cIt has been decided that ONGC Ltd and Oil India Ltd will pay royalty to all similarly placed crude oil producing states at pre-discount prices effective February 1, 2014, pending the outcome of the Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)... filed by ONGC Ltd before the Supreme Court (against the Gujarat High Court order),\u201d the ministry order said. \nWith this order, Assam stands to get more than Rs 1,400 crore as additional royalty from ONGC and Oil India. Andhra Pradesh will get about Rs 72 crore extra royalty from ONGC due to this decision.Source: PTI\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC, Oil India to Pay Higher Royalty to Oil-Producing States\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-07-18 04:05:00"}
