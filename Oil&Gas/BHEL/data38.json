{"text": "\n\n\n\nAre you among those who flock to the Dubai Shopping Festival every January? This year, there\u2019s one at home.The first Mumbai Shopping Festival, modelled around similar events in Dubai, Singapore and Istanbul, kicked off in the second week of January. This weekend, apart from a variety of live performances across the city, there was also a night bazaar.\u201cSome of the best shopping festivals in the world have 8,000-9,000 retailers who participate. If we take one geography in Mumbai; if I take Crawford Market, or a Malad, we\u2019ll have 15,000 retailers here,\u201d said Rahul Gomes, the head of Oaks Management Consultancy, the event management firm that\u2019s organising the festival. \u201cThe intent is to grow this into the largest shopping festival in the world, because we have the population here. We have family, we all have friends, who fly down to Mumbai to shop.\u201dThis year, the festival is spread over three weekends. As an experiment, it\u2019s been a success, Gomes said.On the first weekend, as many as 45,000 people visited the night market along the Worli seaface. If the crowd at 10 p.m. at Malad\u2019s Inorbit Mall was any indicator, the footfall on Friday night would far exceed that number.The recent amendment to the Shops and Establishments Act by the Maharashtra government allowing businesses to stay open at night has already started benefiting retailers, said Rajat Bhargava, head of Inorbit Mall. \u201cThe Christmas weekend and the New Year weekend, we were open past midnight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat has helped a lot. Retailers are now participating in keeping shops open till midnight for sure. They\u2019ve started doing it on the weekends. As the awareness grows, you\u2019re going to have more people visiting.Rajat Bhargava, Head,  Inorbit Mall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe festival gave several foodtrucks an opportunity to ply their trade. Rules don\u2019t allow such trucks in public places in Mumbai. But a mall is considered a private property. So, at the Inorbit Mall night bazaar, visitors were treated to foodtrucks serving everything from maggi bhel to a fusion of Malayali and North Indian cuisines. From the look of it, they did brisk business.Also on offer were Maharashtrian traditional wares and several families had set up stalls. Even an amateur magician was entertaining children.Will the festival in the world\u2019s fourth most populous city weave its magic in the years to come? Dubai will be watching!\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Watch Out Dubai! Mumbai\u2019s Now Got Its Own Night Bazaar\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-20 04:24:00"}
