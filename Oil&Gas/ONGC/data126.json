The ministry of petroleum and natural gas cut the price of domestically-produced natural gas to $2.50 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) for the six months beginning October 1 versus $3.06/mmbtu earlier, according to a statement on its website.The government also revised the ceiling price for 'difficult' (Deepwater, ultradeepwater, high temperature and high pressure) gas discoveries to $5.30/mmbtu for the next six months. Earlier this price was fixed at $6.61/mmbtu for the last six months ending Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoverned by the Modified Rangarajan Formula, India\u2019s domestic gas price is a volume-linked weighted average of gas prices prevailing in multiple global markets. The volume-linked weightage for a certain price is based on the market\u2019s familiarity to India\u2019s import-assisted natural gas economy. Essentially, the government tries to balance the price of natural gas in India to reflect a favourable price for a market that has substantial production as well as import dependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpstream oil companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd., Reliance Industries Ltd., and Oil India Ltd. will be the worst hit by the gas price revision. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC had, therefore, requested the government to revise domestic gas pricing formula, chairman DK Sarraf told BloombergQuint on September 8.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India Cuts Domestic Gas Price By 18%; May Hurt Oil Explorers Like RIL, ONGC\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-10-01 01:45:00"}
