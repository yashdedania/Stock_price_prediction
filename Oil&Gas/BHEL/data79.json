{"text": "\n\n\n\nAsian equity markets recovered some of the losses sustained in the global rout after U.S. shares rallied amid a welter of calls to \u201cbuy the dip.\u201dThe Singapore-traded SGX Nifty, an early indicator of NSE Nifty 50 Index\u2019s performance in India, snaps six-day losing streak and rose 1.1 percent to 10,613.50 as of 6:50 a.m.Short on time? Well, then listen to this podcast for a quick summary of the article!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDayBreak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at all that could influence equities on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Cues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. stocks rebounded from a violent selloff to post the biggest rally in 15 months as investors poured back into some of the most beaten-down sectors.Technology, materials and consumer shares paced a 1.7 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index, while DowDuPont and Home Depot led a 567 point surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the biggest gain in two years.The ride wasn\u2019t straight up, though. The Dow plunged more than 500 points at the open, adding to anxiety after Monday\u2019s rout -- the worst in almost seven years.The benchmark for U.S. share volatility went through wild gyrations after hitting a two-year high.Treasury yields swung before nudging higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n#BQMarketsNow | Stocks recover from rout with best day since 2016.https://t.co/CkDvhQNxA4 pic.twitter.com/WriAVBmJzJ\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) February 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat global policy makers are saying about the stock slide.https://t.co/yW6koDCpiU pic.twitter.com/RZm0V5XU2u\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) February 6, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean stocks posted their worst decline since the aftermath of the Brexit referendum as traders in the region caught up with a selloff in the U.S.After a strong start to 2018, most European stock benchmarks have wiped out gains for the year amid worries over rising government bond yields and the outlook for the trajectory of interest rates. U.S. equity benchmarks fluctuated on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Cues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan\u2019s Topix index advanced 3.2 percent and the Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 3.1 percent.Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 1 percent. The Kospi index in South Korea was up 0.9 percent.Futures on Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5 percent.Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent. The underlying measure gained 1.7 percent Tuesday.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.3 percent.Here are some of the key events scheduled for this week:India\u2019s central bank will probably hold and maintain a neutral stance Wednesday. Governor Urjit Patel is in a bind, needing to both reduce inflation and keep rates low enough to ensure Prime Minister Narendra Modi can bridge a wider fiscal deficit. The Reserve Bank of India is probably overestimating CPI and economic growth, allowing policy makers to tilt back toward easing by midyear, Bloomberg Economics said.Monetary policy decisions are also due this week in Russia, Brazil, Poland, Romania, the U.K., New Zealand, Serbia, Peru and the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\n\nRBI may hold interest rate for the third time in a row.https://t.co/ICJLKXxuLr
