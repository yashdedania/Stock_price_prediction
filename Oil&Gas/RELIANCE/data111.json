{"text": "\n\n\n\nExternal commercial borrowings and funds raised through the domestic bond markets are steadily replacing bank credit. A paper released as part of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\u2018s \u2018Mint Street Memos\u2019 series shows that more than half of the new debt raised in 2016 was raised from outside the Indian banking sector.\u201cIn 2016, non-bank debt through corporate bonds, Commercial Paper (CPs) and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) accounted for more than half of the new debt funding,\u201d said the paper authored by Apoorva Javadekar, research director at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe share of new non-bank credit to total new debt has risen steadily from around 20 percent in 2015 to around 53 percent in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil about a decade ago, most firms relied on bank funding for their needs. 80 percent of new debt funding in 2005 was raised via domestic banks, the study showed. Since then, the dependence on the banking sector has reduced \u201cdramatically\u201d, says the study which adds that firms have opportunistically tapped foreign and domestic markets to borrow funds.The study notes that Indian corporates used ECBs heavily until 2012 but a depreciation in the Indian currency pushed firms to move back onshore for their borrowing needs. This has led to an expansion in funding via domestic debt instruments. CP issuances now constitute a significant segment and represent roughly 25 percent of non-bank credit, the study noted.The study comes at a time when the Indian banking sector is saddled with bad loans, impairing the ability of domestic lenders to lend afresh. As such, a diversification in funding sources may help prevent a shortage in supply of credit for industrial expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results indicate that corporate bond, ECB and CP market have allowed at least a subset of firms to diversify their funding sources. The ability to substitute the sources of financing is important to shield the economy from adverse real effects of a financial crisis.Mint Street Memos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall and medium-sized firms with sound financials have been able to switch to market borrowings, said the study. It added that even large firms with weak financials have been able to tap funds via the debt market. \u201cThis leaves the subset of small firms with poor financials in a vulnerable situation,\u201d the study concluded.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance On Bank Credit Has Reduced \u2018Dramatically\u2019 Over The Past Decade, Shows RBI Study\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-30 12:27:00"}
