{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The first default on U.S. dollar bonds by an Indian company in 15 months may become a closely watched test case for how international creditors will fare under the country\u2019s new bankruptcy laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications Ltd., the Indian mobile phone operator controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, failed to pay a coupon on its 2020 dollar notes before the expiry of a grace period on Monday, according to a person familiar with the matter. It\u2019s India\u2019s most high-profile default on international debt since the nation\u2019s insolvency and bankruptcy code was passed in May 2016. The company\u2019s shares and bonds fell to record lows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rules, part of\u00a0Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push to make India more investor-friendly, are designed to speed up debt restructurings in a country whose banking system is plagued by the highest stressed-asset ratio in 17 years. An improved resolution process would not only encourage foreign money managers to increase holdings of Indian distressed debt, it could also help reduce borrowing costs for companies across the credit spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the restructuring is done properly and fairly, this could set a good precedent and global creditors will take comfort that debt restructuring can have a satisfactory outcome in India,\u201d said Dhiraj Bajaj, Singapore-based portfolio manager at Lombard Odier.\u00a0\u201cHistorically, some debt restructurings have taken years and proved to be very costly for creditors from a time, capital and opportunity cost perspective.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharts show how Reliance Communications\u2019 debt woes mounted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether offshore creditors will utilize the new rules, Ernst & Young LLP says bondholders can prompt companies to come up with a debt resolution plan or face liquidation if they fail to do so after 270 days. There hasn\u2019t yet been a case in India where this process was initiated by offshore bondholders, according to Ernst & Young. The last Indian dollar bond default was Rolta India Ltd., which failed to honor an obligation in August 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the old rules, \u201cthe only option available to bondholders was liquidation,\u201d said Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader for financial services at Ernst & Young. \u201cAnd that took forever.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defaulted 2020 notes issued by Reliance Communications,\u00a0once India\u2019s second-largest wireless operator, were trading at a record low of about 35.6 cents on the dollar as of 4:03 p.m in Hong Kong. The company\u2019s shares slid 3.3 percent to an all-time low of 11.8 rupees. The firm also missed interest payments\u00a0due on Nov. 2 and Nov. 7 on two rupee-denominated bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications reiterated on Saturday that a standstill period for interest and principal repayments continues until December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has proposed a debt resolution plan to lenders that includes lenders converting part of their debt to equity. A filing under the insolvency and bankruptcy code would force the company to come up with a debt resolution plan for all its creditors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: QuickTake explainer on Reliance Communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder India\u2019s\u00a0new rules, anyone who has debt due of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,528) can file for taking the company to a corporate insolvency process,\u00a0according to Ernst & Young\u2019s Diwanji.\u00a0The threat of bondholders taking action in courts could prompt a company to begin talks with bond investors, according to Gunjan Shah, partner at Indian law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe moment an action is filed under the court, the company\u2019s management loses all its powers,\u201d said Shah, adding that noteholders have to weigh their recovery prospects in a liquidation situation. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the problems at Reliance Communications highlight the dangers of investing in Indian companies with high debt, a successful restructuring process could ultimately make the country more attractive for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRecent defaults in the Indian offshore dollar market are going to be interesting test cases for the evolving Indian regulatory system,\u201d said Manjesh Verma, Hong Kong-based head of Asia credit sector specialists at Citigroup Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Communications Defaults in High-Profile India Test\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-22 11:47:00"}
