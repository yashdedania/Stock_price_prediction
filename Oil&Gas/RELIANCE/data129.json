{"text": "\n\n\n\nReliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. said the telecom regulator\u2019s decision to slash interconnect usage charge by more than half to 6 paise benefits users and not the country\u2019s newest telecom operator.\u201cThere is no question of any advantage from the new IUC regulation to Jio as it has already passed on all the benefits to customers,\u201d the Mukesh Ambani-led firm said in a statement. With the cost of voice calls coming down to a fraction of a paisa, customers should be able to enjoy this relief, it said.The operator had demanded that IUC, or fees companies earn to complete calls originating from rivals\u2019 networks, should be abolished. Reliance Jio doesn\u2019t earn from its customers for calls as it offers voice services free. It has to pay rivals for calls the company\u2019s subscribers make to other networks. Moreover, larger rivals like Bharti Airtel, with deeper rural networks, see significantly higher incoming traffic and are net IUC earners, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a July report.The incumbent operators criticised the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India\u2019s decision, and industry body Cellular Operators Association of India said it will challenge the IUC cut in court. Bharti Airtel Ltd., India\u2019s largest operator, had earlier said Reliance Jio\u2019s proposal to abolish the charges would allow the Mukesh Ambani-led company to price services in a predatory manner to monopolise and \u201ckill the industry\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: TRAI\u2019s Decision To Cut Call Connect Charge Based On Flawed Logic, Says Sanjeev Aga\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio said its older rivals \u201chave a history of opposing all the IUC regulations over the last 8 years, but have not been successful in thwarting passing of the benefits... to customers\u201d.\u201cReferences to financial stress in the industry or the need for IUC to promote rural coverage again shows the attitude of the incumbent operators wherein IUC is being treated as a subsidy that the Indian customers must pay to sustain these operators financially,\u201d Reliance Jio said. \u201cOn the contrary, it is a fact that the high-cost IUC regime thus far has caused financial stress for the smaller and new operators.\u201dReliance Jio backed TRAI\u2019s decision to abolish the charges from 2020. That will help make mobile phone services more affordable for Indian customers, it said.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Jio Says Lower Interconnect Charge Benefits Users, Not The Company\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-21 01:59:00"}
