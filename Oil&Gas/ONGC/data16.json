That implies a premium of 13.7 percent over HPCL\u2019s Friday\u2019s closing price. The valuation for the deal was finalised by ONGC\u2019s transaction advisers which included audit firm EY. The \u2018alternative mechanism\u2019 under the chairmanship of the finance minister yesterday approved the bid price and the terms and conditions of the sale. The deal will be completed by the end of this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had engaged an independent agency for evaluation. They did the evaluation and we had kept an advisor. The price recommended is well below the recommended price by independent agencies.Shashi Shanker, Chairman And Managing Director, ONGC \n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC\u2019s board has approved raising up to Rs 35,000 crore from the markets, Shashi Shanker, chairman and managing director of ONGC said in a media conference on Sunday. \u201cWe have cash balances with us and some liquid assets to the tune of around Rs 29,000-30,000 crore,\u201d he added. Shanker didn\u2019t give specifics of how the acquisition will be funded but said that the most economical plan would be used.The deal would not hurt ONGC\u2019s appetite for acquisition of overseas assets, neither will it impact the growth plans of HPCL, Shanker said. He added that the individual identities of both companies will continue to exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPCL will continue to run the way it has been running. There will be no major changes.Shashi Shanker, Chairman And Managing Director, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe share purchase is exempt from the requirement of open offer, as it is covered by a statutory exemption in the takeover code, ONGC said in the statement. Under the market regulator\u2019s takeover code, an entity acquiring more than 25 percent in a listed company has to make an offer to buy another 26 percent from public shareholders. The deal does not require any other regulatory approval as it has been exempted from the Competition Act, the statement said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Oil Giant In Making: ONGC To Buy Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government\u2019s share sale is part of its effort to create a state-run oil behemoth to better compete with global rivals. The deal will also help it exceed its Rs 72,500-crore selloff target at a time when India has already breached its fiscal deficit target in the first eight months of the year to March. The government\u2019s total divestment proceeds as on Jan 20. stood at Rs 54,338 crore. The ONGC-HPCL transaction will take it to more than Rs 91,000 crore.\u201cONGC expects that as an integrated oil conglomerate, its performance will be less affected by the volatility of crude prices due to diversification of its cash flows to midstream and downstream presence through HPCL, lower earnings volatility, diversified cash flows and lower business risk resulting in better valuation and higher shareholder value,\u201d the company said in a statement. The ONGC-HPCL combine will become India\u2019s third-largest oil refiner behind Indian Oil Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward, there is also a possibility of a merger between HPCL and ONGC\u2019s subsidiary Mangalore Refinery And Petrochemicals Ltd. \u201cIt is a logical option,\u201d Shanker added when asked about the future roadmap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC\u2019s board had given the nod in August to acquire the government\u2019s stake in HPCL. The cash-rich explorer will tap the debt market for the first time to raise Rs 25,000 crore to part-fund the purchase, Bloomberg had reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated to add the management commentary from ONGC\u2019s press conference held on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC, HPCL To Retain Individual Identities Post Stake Purchase, Says ONGC CMD\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-23 04:59:00"}
