Accordingly, he had expected promotional offers to last 30-60 days, but not seven months. Mittal was speaking to BloombergQuint\u2019s Menaka Doshi on the sidelines of the 47th World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The merger of Vodafone India Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd., if it were to indeed materialise, would be a \u2018perfect match, according to Mittal.Here are edited excerpts from the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Davos 2017: Revenue Market Share At Lifetime High Despite Reliance Jio, Says Sunil Bharti Mittal\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-22 05:23:00"}
