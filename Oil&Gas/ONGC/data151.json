{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Oil and Natural Gas Corp. plans to tap the debt market for the first time, an opportunity that may be hard to pass up for bond bulls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s largest state-run energy producer may sell bonds and take out loans of as much as $4 billion to pay for the purchase of the government\u2019s $5.2 billion stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. and bankroll $4.5 billion of projects, according to company executives with knowledge of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the company\u2019s credit metrics -- it has 130 billion rupees ($2 billion) of cash on its books and a long-term rating that\u2019s a notch above the government -- the issuance will be bought by investors drawn to one of the world\u2019s fastest growth rates and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s economic policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sentiment is positive toward India and because the supply from Indian corporates is limited, there will be demand,\u201d Rishabh Tiwari, a Zurich-based fund manager for emerging market credit at Swiss Life Asset Managers, said in an interview. \u201cONGC has strong credit fundamentals and the acquisition of HPCL will help it diversify into downstream refining.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appetite for India\u2019s corporate debt is so strong that Hindustan Petroleum\u2019s $500 million offering in July attracted bids for six times the amount. Billionaire Anil Agarwal\u2019s Vedanta Resources Plc last week sold seven-year dollar notes in its second $1 billion sale this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, the planned fundraising could weaken ONGC\u2019s credit profile at a time when earnings have been\u00a0hit by the slump in global energy prices. Estimated cash flows of about 400 billion rupees this fiscal won\u2019t be enough to pay for the planned investments, the executives said, asking not to be identified as they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC shares fell 2.5 percent to 159.65 rupees at the close. The stock has lost 17 percent this year, compared with the 17 percent advance in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Premium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Swiss Life Asset and Frankfurt-based Union Investment Privatfonds, it boils down to how attractively the issuance is priced. The HPCL acquisition, if funded by debt, could lead to the company\u2019s standalone rating being cut by a notch, Swiss Life\u2019s Tiwari said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf ONGC is willing to reflect the increased credit risk premium in light of the transaction, there\u2019ll be interested investors,\u201d said Hyun Kim, who manages $2 billion under four funds at Union Investment. \u201cONGC was one of the strongest quasi-sovereign credits before the HPCL transaction was announced. Leverage will likely increase with this, but the company should be able to handle it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t borrowed since at least 1993 when it was converted into a corporation, the executives said. Its overseas investment unit, ONGC Videsh Ltd., has tapped the market to fund purchases of oil and gas blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service has a Baa2 score on ONGC\u2019s debt, making it the nation\u2019s highest rated state-run company, said Vikas Halan,\u00a0vice president and senior credit officer at rating company. That should provide the company with a \"very strong access\" to funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Biggest Indian Explorer Is Said to Plan First Ever Borrowing\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-08-12 06:35:00"}
