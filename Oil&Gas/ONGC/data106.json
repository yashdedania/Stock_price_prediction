Of the total investment, around Rs 10,000 crore will be spent on onshore blocks, and the balance Rs 68,000 crore on offshore assets in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. The company expects to commence investment in financial year (FY) 2017-18 and finish by FY21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe huge capital outlay will be credit negative for ONGC and lead to an upfront increase in leverage. At the same time, the development of oil and gas assets has a long gestation period before contributing meaningfully to earnings and cash flows.Moody\u2019s Analysis Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that the investment is spread equally over FY18 and FY19, ONGC's cash-flow-to-debt ratio is expected to decline to 40 percent by March 2018 and 33 percent by March 2019, it added.If ONGC takes on this investment, it will not leave any room for the company to increase its debt, the report said.However, the oil and gas major\u2019s sizeable cash balances worth Rs 25,800 crore as of March 31, 2016 supports its baseline credit assessment, which reflects its fundamental Baa1 credit strength, added the report. During the initial development period, ONGC\u2019s borrowings will remain elevated for its Baa1 rating category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Rescues GSPC From Drowning In The Deep-Water? \n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC\u2019s Rs 78,000-Crore Investment Plan Likely To Hit Its Credit Rating: Moody\u2019s\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-02-06 01:51:00"}
