The transaction could fetch another Rs 5,000 crore through regulatory assets under approval and Rs 550 crore from net working capital. That would take the total consideration to Rs 18,800 crore.The business includes generation, transmission, and distribution of power across Mumbai and caters to nearly 3 million residential, industrial, and commercial consumers in suburbs of the city covering around 400 square kilometres.Reliance Infrastructure will use the proceeds to reduce its debt, it said. It will also be looking to monetise its cement, road and telecom tower assets to reduce overall debt, which stood at Rs 25,800 crore as of March 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire money that we receive (Rs 13,800 crore) will be used to pay off the debt.So its not a question of transferring debt and equityLalit Jalan, CEO, Reliance Infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire deal is a cash transaction and is expected to be complete by March 31, 2018, he said while speaking to BloombergQuint.After the entire deal is gone through (Rs 18,800 crore), the company is expected to be debt free and would remain with a surplus of Rs 3,000 crore.\u201c The surplus 3000 crore is essentially shareholders\u2019 money and we don\u2019t need money for capital expenditure.
