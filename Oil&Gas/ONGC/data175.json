{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nTraders continued to unwind previous positions in the futures contracts of India\u2019s major equity indices despite the Nifty 50 and the Bank Nifty closing flat. Open interest for both Nifty and Nifty Bank futures declined on Thursday. While little changed for positions taken by foreign investors in index futures, stock futures worth Rs 594 crores were bought into on a net basis.The India Volatility Index (VIX) advanced 2.7 percent to close at 11.2 to reflect expansion in option premiums. This ordinarily indicates an increase in traders\u2019 expectation of volatility in the near-term. The Nifty Put Call Ratio, which is the total open interest in Nifty put options to that of call options, increased marginally to 1.21 from 1.22. This measure reflects the number of calls written in comparison to puts in the Nifty.While the Nifty remained flat, most activity was witnessed in the 9,800, 9,650 call options which added 3 lakh and 2.4 lakh shares respectively in open interest and the 9,600 put which shed 11 lakh shares in open interest. Maximum open interest remained with the 9,700 call and the 9,500 put in the June series. This broadly indicates a near-term range for the Nifty anticipated by traders.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Index Futures See Unwinding Even As Indices Remain Flat\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-06-22 05:58:00"}
