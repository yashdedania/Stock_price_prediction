{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is breaking with recent U.S. convention by portraying China as a rival that wants to undermine American prosperity. But it may take more than an aggressive tone to change the complex relationship between two economies that are joined at the hip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new national-security strategy released Monday, the White House lumped China with Russia as powers seeking to \u201cchallenge American power, influence, and interests,\u201d and attempting to erode the country\u2019s security and prosperity. \u201cWe will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rhetoric contrasts with\u00a0the more collaborative approach of former President Barack Obama, who courted China as an economic partner even as the U.S. asserted its military power in Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder his America First approach to foreign policy, Trump says he will try to eliminate America\u2019s $500-billion total trade deficit by insisting on \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d commerce with other nations, and strengthen the national security test for foreign investments. At the same time, Trump is juggling the more imminent need of working with China to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here, for more on the higher hurdles being proposed for foreign investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. strategy may convince China to ease some trade barriers, giving U.S. firms more access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. But it will be difficult to eliminate America\u2019s $309-billion trade shortfall with China without deeper reforms to the nature of each country\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because trade flows are heavily influenced by the amount that countries save and invest. When a nation invests more than it saves, as the U.S. does, it will import more than it exports, and finance the resulting current-account deficit by borrowing from abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cChina has lots of protections in place, so the U.S. has legitimate issues on market access,\u201d said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s economic emissary to China under Obama. \u201cBut even if they did everything we wanted, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily change the trade balance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and other countries have been pushing China for years to transition from an export-driven, state-led growth model to one more reliant on domestic consumption. For its part, the U.S. could take steps to increase savings, and therefore narrow the trade deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s official English-language newspaper China Daily sought to play down the accusation on Tuesday, saying in an editorial that the speech still recognizes that the two nations\u2019 interests are \"increasingly interwoven.\" Still, the editorial raised the prospect of \"exacerbated frictions over trade\", with Trump promoting economic strength as indispensable for national security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDollar Boost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican plans to cut taxes may undermine Trump\u2019s trade goals, by giving a short-term boost to the U.S. economy that strengthens the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive, said Eswar Prasad, a China expert at Cornell University. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s tough rhetoric on China is a cross-purposes with its own domestic and international economic policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalks between the U.S. and China through their main economic channel have stalled. But the two nations have little choice but to cooperate, given the intertwined nature of their economies, said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust look at the iPhone, which is produced in China with a lot of suppliers having moved to China to support production,\u201d Wessel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Trump has so far deferred specific measures to crack down on China\u2019s trade practices, his administration is considering tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and probing China\u2019s intellectual-property practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the administration chooses a more muscular course, then the Chinese authorities could retaliate or move toward the global moral high ground of using WTO and other existing mechanisms,\u201d Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income, who served as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under Obama. \u201cMy hunch is it will probably be some of both.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Scrutiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, U.S. policy toward China has shifted to increasingly looking at trade issues through a security lens. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he\u2019s spending more time on sanctions and national security-related issues as the Treasury accelerates the use of sanctions to cut off North Korea\u2019s ties with the U.S. financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMnuchin has has urged closer vetting of foreign acquisitions by the security-review panel he chairs, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cfius, while maintaining an investor-friendly climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is growing for strengthening Cfius. On Monday, Defense Secretary James Mattis joined Mnuchin and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in supporting proposed legislation led by Republican Senator John Cornyn calling for tougher security reviews for foreign investors seeking to acquire and invest in U.S. companies, particularly targeting China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday, before the launch of that security strategy in Washington, that U.S.-China trade ties are win-win and that China will continue to liberalize its trade and investment policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Trump's Rivalry With China Overlooks U.S. Economic Reliance\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-12-19 11:40:00"}
