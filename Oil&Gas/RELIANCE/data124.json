{"text": "\n\n\n\nLenders to Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCom) have reached out to the company to seek reassurance that deleveraging deals initiated by it are on track, two people with direct knowledge of the development told BloombergQuint. Lenders have turned nervous as a pending merger with Aircel Ltd. is yet to conclude and recent developments, such as a cut in interconnect charges, could worsen the financials of the telecom firm.According to the first person quoted above, lenders are worried that the merger with Aircel could be delayed due to creditor Ericsson India\u2019s decision to file an insolvency plea against Reliance Communications.In a stock exchange filing on September 13, Reliance Communications said Ericsson India has filed a petition under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to recover Rs 491.41 crore from the company. \u201cEricsson has also filed similar petitions against Reliance Infratel Limited and Reliance Telecom Limited, subsidiaries of the company for recovery of an amount of Rs 534.75 crore and Rs 129.34 crore respectively,\u201d the company disclosed.Lenders fear this could impact an earlier plan agreed upon in June. Back then, the company and its bankers had agreed to invoke strategic debt restructuring (SDR) to convert the company\u2019s debt into equity. Banks would hold this equity till pending deleveraging transactions and the proposed merger with Aircel concluded. Conversion of the debt to equity had allowed banks to defer additional provisioning on nearly Rs 22,000 crore in loans.Reliance Communications, on its part, has reassured lenders that it will complete pending transactions in time, said the bankers quoted above. The company is also confident that it will be able to negotiate a deal with operational creditors seeking to invoke insolvency provisions to recover dues, they said.In addition, banks involved in the RCom case have been bothered by the news that Aircel is considering insolvency as an option to deal with its own financial stress. According to the second person quoted above, Aircel is currently talking to its lawyers to see how it can utilize provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.Aircel has denied this. \"It is business as usual at Aircel, the company denies any move to file for bankruptcy,\" a spokesperson told BloombergQuint.If Reliance Communications is not able to complete the promised deals before December, lenders to the company will be forced to take over the company by converting debt to equity. Under the provisions of SDR, banks have six months to actually convert debt to equity following the invocation of the scheme. Lenders had used the scheme to prevent the account from turning non-performing, which would necessitate additional provisions.Meantime there has been little improvement in the operating environment for the company. If anything, recent regulatory changes could prove to be negative for the company.On Tuesday, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reduced the interconnect usage charges to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise earlier. This move is expected to cause considerable pain to the voice calling businesses of all established network providers in India, said Fitch Ratings. \u201cThis will place further pressure on these companies, which are already facing unprecedented competition from (Reliance) Jio,\u201d the rating agency said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        With Deal Closures Pending, Lenders Seek Reassurance From Reliance Communications\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-22 06:32:00"}
