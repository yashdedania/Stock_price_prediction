This stake was later divided between OVL and Oil India Ltd. in the ratio of 60:40.The deal has now come under the oil ministry's scanner following allegations that OVL might have overpaid Videocon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment officials said the ministry has over the past few months asked the company to provide several details of the deal including the basis of the valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquest by the ministry was acknowledged by senior company officials, who said details have been provided on multiple occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources said Videocon was willing to sell its stake to OVL in 2012, at a small premium to the price Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production paid for acquiring an 8.5 percent stake in the same block from Cove Energy for \u00a31.22 billion ($1.9 billion at exchange rate prevalent at that time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 percent stake, they said, was available to OVL for about $2.3 billion or so but the company a year later paid $2.475 billion to Videocon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn e-mail sent to ONGC Chairman Dinesh K Sarraf, who was Managing Director of OVL at the time of the deal, for comments received a response from the company stating: \u201cThere is no basis to this allegation and ONGC Videsh strongly refutes it.\u201dOVL had followed up the Videocon purchase by buying another 10 percent stake in the same Offshore Area 1 of Mozambique from U.S. energy major Anadarko Corp for $2.64 billion in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, Anadarko in its annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it made a \u2018gain\u2019 of $1.5 billion or over 62 percent of the purchase price, from the sale of 10 percent interest in Offshore Area 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodlands, Texas-based energy exploration company Anadarko continues to be the operator of the block, with its stake reduced to 26.5 percent from 36.5 percent after the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresently, OVL has 16 percent stake in Offshore Area 1, which holds as much as 75 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOIL has 4 percent and a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL) another 10 percent stake. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 percent stake, ENH (15 percent) and PTTEP (8.5 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas from the block is to be converted into Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for transportation by ships to markets like India.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC\u2019s $2.4-Billion Mozambique Deal Under Oil Ministry\u2019s Scanner \u00a0  \u00a0\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-02-12 08:22:00"}
