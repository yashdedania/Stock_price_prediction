{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Asia\u2019s booming bond market is leaving distressed-debt investors with few options to bet on for the new year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Asia\u2019s bond sales surpass $300 billion,\u00a0the region\u2019s junk bond yields have\u00a0slipped below its five-year average this year, keeping some of the lowest-rated stressed issuers afloat. Hedge funds dedicated to distressed strategies for 2018 will likely focus on the big names like Noble Group Ltd. and Reliance Communications Ltd., which are seeking to restructure more than $8 billion of debt combined, investors said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNormalized commodity markets as well as strong primary issuance markets in Asia have helped some of the weaker credits term out their debt,\u201d said Ani Deshmukh, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Nexus Investment Advisors Ltd. \u201cApart from a few remaining large-cap situations like Noble, we expect fewer opportunities in 2018 in Asia\u2019s G3 bond market barring a material risk-off.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal hedge funds dedicated to distressed strategies have gained about 5 percent this year through October, according to industry researcher Eurekahedge, falling off the pace in 2016. Within Asian junk bonds, notes graded in the lower half of the range have risen two times more than their stronger peers this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-yield default rates in Asia are expected to end at 2.3 percent in 2017, up from 1 percent in 2016, before moderating to 1.1 percent next year, according to a December report by JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors agreed to debt swaps offered by Mongolian Mining Corp. and PT Bumi Resources as coal prices recovered, while PT Indika Energy, Vedanta Resources Plc managed to sell new bonds. Tiremaker PT Gajah Tunggal and Anton Oilfield Services Group have also refinanced while Global A&T Electronics Ltd. and China Fishery Group Ltd. are close to finishing their debt reorganizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe next big event will be Noble Group, which is going to get restructured,\u201d said Alex Turnbull, Singapore-based managing partner at Keshik Capital Pte. \u201cPlus, there\u2019s an epic and protracted bank loan cleanup in India, which will run for years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoble Group, the embattled Hong Kong-based commodity trader, started engaging creditors in November to reorganize $3.5 billion of debt in the newest chapter of its three-year survival battle. At Reliance Communications, a collapse in its asset-sale program has pushed the Indian telecommunications firm into a default, another blemish in the banking system wracked by $207 billion of bad loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe supply of stressed loans in India will increase, offering interesting opportunities for investors as the bankruptcy court process picks up steam, Deshmukh said. Last month, China Development Bank asked a local tribunal to place Reliance Communications under insolvency proceedings to recover its loan,\u00a0according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD: Bad-Loan Recast Failures Portend More Pain for India Lenders (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeshik Capital sees ominous signs in weaker retail spending in Australia that has afflicted department-store operators like Myer Holdings Ltd. while OrotonGroup Ltd. slipped into administration. The growth in online lending platforms in China and a crackdown on Ponzi schemes by regulators could add to credit-market stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will probably see some retail blowups in Australia and some dead P2P lenders in China,\u201d Keshik Capital\u2019s Turnbull said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian HY bonds returned 6.6% this year through Dec. 6 vs 14.3% in 2016, according to ICE BofAML index, while a U.S. junk-bond index +7.2% (2016: 17.5%) and the stock benchmark MSCI World Index +17.6% (2016: 5.3%)PerformersIndika Energy 6.375% 2023 notes returned 51%Yingde Gases\u00a07.25% 2020 notes returned 43% Perusahaan Listrik Negara\u2019s 5.25% 2042 notes returned 23%LaggardsReliance Communications 6.5% 2020 notes lost 60%Noble Group 8.75% 2022 notes lost 51%Click here to read more on ASIAN DISTRESSED WATCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Asia Distressed Debt Drought Keeps Focus on Noble, Reliance\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-12-08 02:00:00"}
