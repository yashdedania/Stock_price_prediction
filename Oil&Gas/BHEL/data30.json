{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Norway\u2019s $940 billion sovereign wealth fund excluded Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. on environmental grounds, placed PetroChina Co. and Leonardo SpA under observation and said it will follow up with Eni SpA and Saipem SpA on the risks of corruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBharat Heavy, based in New Delhi, was excluded from the fund \u201cbased on an assessment of the risk of severe environmental damage\u201d after a recommendation from the Council on Ethics, the central bank, which oversees the fund, said in a statement. BHEL officials couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company is building a coal-fired power plant close to areas with \u201cuniversally unique environmental qualities in the Sundarbans, the world\u2019s largest mangrove forest, in southern Bangladesh,\u201d the council said in a separate statement. \u201cThere\u2019s an unacceptable risk of the company contributing to or being responsible for severe environmental damage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s largest wealth fund takes into account ethical rules encompassing human rights, some weapons production, corruption, the environment, coal and tobacco when deciding on its investments. The fund sells its stakes before it announces an exclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetroChina and Leonardo were placed under observation, a preliminary step before a potential exclusion, based on an \u201cunacceptable risk that the companies contribute to, or are responsible for, severe corruption,\u201d the bank said. The ethics watchdog had recommended the fund exclude the companies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank also went against the council\u2019s recommendation to put Eni and Saipem under observation, saying it will follow up with \u201cactive ownership\u201d and \u201craise the issue of the risk of severe corruption\u201d with the companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Executive Board concludes that it is appropriate to use other measures, and that they probably will be better suited to reduce the risk of continued norm violations in these cases,\u201d the bank said in the statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Norway Wealth Fund Drops Bharat Heavy on Environmental Risk\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-05-07 10:00:00"}
