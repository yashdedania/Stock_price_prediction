We have asked BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.) to send their experts on the site too.Gurdeep Singh, Chairman, NTPC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: NTPC Shuts Unchahar Plant Unit After Blast Claims 26 Lives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingh also said that the material used in the unit was manufactured and designed by BHEL, which will be replaced.\u201cBHEL and NTPC both are discussing how soon we can revive the unit. Some of the material will have to be manufactured and supplied again. It will take 3-6 months,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Caused The BlastWhenever there is some change in the coal being fired in the boiler, at times there is some bottom ash which is evacuated from beneath of the furnace, Singh explained, adding that some kind of accumulation of ash was noticed. Pressure went up and machine had tripped. Economiser section got opened up.The opening up of economiser section of the boiler caused ash content to release and people working nearby got affected.But Singh declined to comment on what actually caused the accident and whether there was some human error. \u201cSaying what actually happened is not correct unless we have completely analysed report by experts. We will take corrective actions whether they were design related,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        NTPC Forms Internal Committee To Probe Unchahar Plant Blast\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-03 12:03:00"}
