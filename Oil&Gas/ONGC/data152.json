{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s biggest oil explorer plans to snatch up producing assets to reach its goal of raising overseas output by more than half in about three years, a faster route than drilling for new reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC Videsh Ltd., the overseas investment unit of state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp., spent $2.2 billion last year on an existing Russian project, which raised production by 4 million tons, or 44 percent. The company still needs to add more than 7 million tons to achieve its target of 20 million tons by 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShort-term production goals can only be achieved through producing assets because the exploration life cycle is very long,\u201d Managing Director Narendra Kumar Verma said in an interview last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are focusing on producing assets to boost production in short term.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent ONGC\u2019s shares rose as much as 2 percent to 197.25 rupees and traded 1.3 percent higher\u00a0at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday in Mumbai. They were the top performer on the benchmark Sensex, which was up 0.1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing India\u2019s energy companies to raise domestic output and secure assets overseas to bolster energy security for a country that imports more than 80 percent of its oil. Adding supplies through the purchase of producing assets is a faster, and potentially more-costly, alternative to exploring and developing new fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC Videsh, the nation\u2019s largest overseas oil and gas investor, is struggling to reverse declining output from Russian unit Imperial Energy Corp., which it acquired in 2008, revive assets in troubled Sudan and Syria, raise production in Venezuela and start pumping from Mozambique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company bought a 26 percent stake in Russia\u2019s Vankor project last year from oil giant Rosneft, lifting its overall output to about 12.8 million tons in the year ended March 31, from 8.92 million in the previous year. The company expects total output to reach 14 million tons by March, with half of that coming from Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRussia has been giving us good opportunities, and our governments share good relations,\u201d Verma said. The company is working toward a more diversified portfolio, he said, \u201cbut if a good opportunity emerges again in Russia, we will not hesitate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oil price crash that started in 2014 helped the company bulk up on assets that have been in production for years. Global benchmark Brent oil, which hit the lowest in more than a decade during January 2016, has recovered to about $65 a barrel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely the low oil price has offered a window of opportunity for us to consolidate and increase our footprint,\u201d Verma said. \u201cGradually, people are reconciling with the low prices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Top\u00a0India Explorer to Buy, Not Drill, Its Way to Output Goal\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-12-27 07:55:00"}
