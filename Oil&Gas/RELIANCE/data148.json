Inflow of funds appear limited in the engineering, procurement and construction business due to lack of significant new projects and external contracts, it said.A lag in monetisation of road assets and delay in raising of capital through qualified institutional placement has held back Reliance Infra\u2019s debt-reduction plan. \u201cContinued support extended to group companies and associates in the form of loans and advances is impacting the financial risk and liquidity of the company,\u201d said the rating agency.Revised RatingsLong-term bank facilities worth Rs 3,700 crore demoted to A- from A+.Short-term facilities of Rs 1,500 crore have been rated A2+, from the previous A1+ rating.Long-term non-convertible debentures in three categories \u2013 worth Rs 800 crore, Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 200 crore \u2013 have been reduced to an A- rating from A+.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        CARE Downgrades Reliance Infrastructure\u2019s Debt\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-09-04 11:22:00"}
