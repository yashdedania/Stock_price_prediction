The Bloomberg consensus of analyst estimates had pegged profit at Rs 8,665 crore. Revenue net of excise duty went up 6.7 percent to Rs 68,532 crore.Operating income rose 12 percent sequentially to Rs 12,983 crore. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 18.8 percent.Reliance Industries\u2019 gross refining margin, or what it makes on refining every barrel of crude, increased to $12, the highest in nine years. That\u2019s lower than the estimated $12.5 per barrel. The premium that Reliance commands over the Asian benchmark Singapore gross refining margins also narrowed to $3.7 from $5.5 in the previous quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA marginal miss on the refining margin should not be seen as a negative, according to Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services. It\u2019s not a matter of concern as oil prices are likely to stay at a lower level as there is no demand-supply mismatch, Shah told BloombergQuint over the phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance reported its best-ever operational performance in its mainstay refining and petrochemical business. That was on account of \"higher volumes, better margin environment and operational excellence\", according chief financial officer Alok Agarwal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results also reflect strong underlying fundamentals of our refining and petrochemicals businesses.\u00a0\n\nMukesh Ambani, Chairman And Managing Director, RIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetrochemicals Business\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue from the petrochemicals business rose 10 percent sequentially to Rs 27,999 crore. Petrochemicals margins expanded by 190 basis points to 17.7 percent, the highest in the last 10 years.The petrochemicals business also recorded the highest ever earnings before interest and tax of Rs 4,960 crore, led by volume growth.Production increased to 7.5 million metric tonnes from 6.5 million metric tonnes in the previous quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Business\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organised retail revenue grew 27 percent over the previous quarter to Rs 14,646 crore. That was driven by a growth in digital, fashion and lifestyle and petroleum products.The retail business is still too small to make a meaningful difference. The exploration and production business, too, does not move the needle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio\u2019s Positive Suprise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s telecom arm Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. reported a loss at Rs 271 crore for the July-September quarter but still managed to deliver a positive surprise. It\u2019s the first time Reliance has disclosed earnings for the business.Despite being the latest entrant in India\u2019s crowded mobile-phone market, Jio added 15.3 million net subscribers during the quarter, taking the total subscriber base to 138.6 million.

The average revenue per minute was strong at Rs 156.4 per user a month.Jio had a positive EBIT contribution in its first quarter of commercial operations, RIL\u2019s Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said in a media statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strong financial results of Jio demonstrates the robust business model of Jio and the significant efficiencies that the company has built through its investment in the latest 4G technology and right business strategy.\u00a0\n\nMukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, RIL \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Posts Strong Revenue Per User\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Highlights From Reliance JioStandalone EBITDA: Rs 1,443 croreEBITDA margin: 23.5 percentJio customer churn at 1 percent per month, expected to reduce further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Q2 Earnings Below Estimates,  Jio Surprises\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-13 03:54:00"}
