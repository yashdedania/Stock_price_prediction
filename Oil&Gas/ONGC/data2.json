In cases where such an approval has not been taken, the Act allows for ratification till three months\u2019 time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Is Said to Plan $4.8 Billion Indian Oil, GAIL Stake Sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is understandable for routine transactions which are in the ordinary course of business. But given the legal and operational complexities in rolling back stake purchases, as a good governance measure, ONGC should have refrained from going ahead with the transaction before the shareholder vote.Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Limited Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the company\u2019s assertion in the shareholder notice that seeking prior approval for a price sensitive deal was impracticable, IiAS said that \u201cit is unfathomable, given that the purchase has been under consideration for several months and there was no real urgency to close the deal.\u201d\u201cWhy could ONGC not wait for shareholders\u2019 approval before purchasing the stake? What happens if the resolution is defeated? Does the company have a plan in place to rollback the transaction in case the resolution is defeated?\u201d asked IiAS.Both the Companies Act and SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 exempt public-sector undertakings from seeking shareholder approval where the RPTs are conducted with another PSU. But there are no such exemptions for transactions between the government and a PSU.\u201cDespite this, SEBI, vide its letter dated November 30, 2017, has already granted exemption to ONGC from having to take shareholders\u2019 approval. ONGC has also applied to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs for an exemption \u2013 once granted the current resolution (seeking shareholder nod) will be withdrawn. IiAS believes this renders otiose the entire exercise,\u201d the note said.IiAS said that discerning shareholders who have taken the time and effort to analyse and vote will be left in the lurch if the resolution were to be withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: India's ONGC Is Said to Expect Delays in Its Biggest Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt went on to ask if ONGC should be given preferential treatment, thereby avoiding the shareholder voting process.Stating that PSU shareholders have expectations regarding governance standards, it said that the current legal framework fails to provide a level playing field.\u201cThe government is often able to push its agenda forward, which might not always be in the best interests of the company\u2019s direct and immediate stakeholders,\u201d it said.The advisory firm said there is a need for greater introspection across the board. \u201cIn the listed space, there cannot be different standards for PSUs and private companies. It is time for the Government and regulators to bridge this governance gap,\u201d IiAS added.While listing of PSUs is cited as the biggest driver of accountability and transparency, there is a big divergence in standards applicable for state-owned and private companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn ONGC\u2019s case, the company is seeking regulatory exemptions. While IiAS supports the overall transaction, it believes that such leniency with regard to public votes are not warranted,\u201d the note said.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Proxy Advisory Firm Questions Exemptions In The ONGC-HPCL Deal\u00a0\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-03-05 01:05:00"}
