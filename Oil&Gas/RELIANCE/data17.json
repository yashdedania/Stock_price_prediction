The existing plans will now offer data at 25-33 percent cheaper rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio lowered prices after Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s largest telecom operator, revised its tariffs earlier in the morning. It now offers more data on existing plans, reducing the cost per GB by 20-29 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Reliance Jio offers cheaper data in most of its plans. Only one Bharti Airtel plan is cheaper than that of India\u2019s newest wireless carrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio has been lowering tariffs to protect its market share and not profitability, said a note released by Credit Suisse.
