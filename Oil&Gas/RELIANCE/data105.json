{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Communications Ltd.\u2019s plan to merge with Aircel Ltd. collapsed in a blow to the Indian mobile phone carriers\u2019 plans to pare debt and gain scale to take on bigger rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLegal uncertainties\u201d and \u201cinterventions by vested interests\u201d caused delays in regulatory approvals, Reliance Communications said in an exchange filing on Sunday. Consequently, the merger has \u201clapsed with mutual consent,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaire Anil Ambani\u2019s Reliance and T. Ananda Krishnan\u2019s Aircel, a unit of Malaysia-based Maxis Communications Bhd., were due to complete the transaction this year. India\u2019s mobile carriers have been locked in a price war that had worsened with the entry of Ambani\u2019s older brother, India\u2019s richest person, into the market a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal would have created India\u2019s fourth-largest carrier and given the companies more room to pay down combined debt that soared to about 600 billion rupees ($9.2 billion) as of the end of last year. Aircel was one of several possible transactions that Ambani was pushing as a way to\u00a0reduce Reliance\u2019s debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications will consider an alternate plan to cut debt, which includes sharing and trading of its airwaves valued at about 190 billion rupees, the company said in the statement Sunday. It will also consider plans to monetize its real estate, tower and fiber businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately, Reliance Communications expanded its board, adding Punit Garg, president of the telecom business, as an executive director and Manikantan V., the company\u2019s chief financial officer, as a director, it said in a statement Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Anil Ambani\u2019s planned asset sales here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks that lent to Ambani\u2019s companies have met with executives from the group to push for a reduction in debt by selling assets, people familiar with the matter, who didn\u2019t want to be named because the talks were private, have said. RCom, as the wireless unit is known, got a seven-month reprieve from lenders in June to raise money from deals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed merger with Aircel, Reliance would have transfered more than 40 percent of its debt, or 200 billion rupees, to a new joint venture. Aircel, which is controlled by a unit of\u00a0Maxis Bhd., would have offloaded 40 billion rupees of debt to the venture. Maxis shares were little changed at 5.81 ringgit as of the close of Kuala Lumpur trading Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Krishnan,\u00a0Malaysia\u2019s third-richest person, a deal with Reliance would have helped him hedge some of the risk of vying for subscribers in India\u2019s fragmented mobile phone services market. Last year, an Indian court issued an arrest warrant for Krishnan over his alleged role in a years-old bribery scandal involving the purchase of mobile-phone airwaves -- allegations that the tycoon has denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office of the chief operating officer of Usaha Tegas Sdn, Krishnan\u2019s closely held company, said by phone that it had no comment on the collapse of the Reliance deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the proposed merger were the rising difficulties of making money in a market that has some of the lowest phone rates in the world. One company responsible for escalating the rivalry is the market\u2019s newest entrant, Jio, which is controlled by Ambani\u2019s older brother Mukesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith India\u2019s larger mobile players battling for market share, smaller carriers are doomed in the long term, according to Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. As of the end of July, Aircel was the sixth-largest operator in India with a 7.6 percent market share, followed by Reliance Communications with 6.9 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Reliance, which for years was the country\u2019s second-largest carrier, it\u2019s been a long descent. The company posted profit declines for six out of seven years before posting its first annual loss last fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe merger also faced difficulties because of creditors, who didn\u2019t all support the combination. One of the creditors, Ericsson AB, initiated an insolvency petition in September to recover dues of 11.6 billion rupees -- allegations that Reliance has said it plans to challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance continues to be under \u201ca standstill period\u201d till December 2018 and expects to complete debt-restructuring process as per rules, it said in the statement. Shareholders have approved the issue of equity shares to lenders by conversion of loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s financial markets are closed Monday for a national holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Communications Aborts Aircel Deal in Debt-Cut Blow\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-03 10:09:00"}
