{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s plan to push its top oil producer to fund a takeover of a state refining company may threaten some near-term investments including a plan to revive a long-delayed development project aimed at cutting the nation\u2019s energy imports, according to company officials with knowledge of its finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil & Natural Gas Corp.\u2019s\u00a0capital expenditure plans, including a $4.5 billion investment in its oil and gas blocks during the year starting in April 1, would be imperiled by the government\u2019s proposal, said the officials, who asked not to be named because the information isn\u2019t public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to push ONGC to purchase the government\u2019s stake in either Hindustan Petroleum Corp., worth $4 billion, or Bharat Petroleum Corp., at $7.7 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said. India is planning to\u00a0create a state-owned oil giant that could compare with international companies and withstand volatility in oil prices. ONGC hasn\u2019t been approached by the government yet, the company officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor ONGC it will be difficult since exploration and production companies require a lot of cash,\u201d according to Vaibhav Chowdhry, a senior analyst at K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. \u201cIf they buy the full stake in HPCL their cash levels will go down. So funding future exploration will be very difficult.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC has surplus cash of about 100 billion rupees ($1.5 billion), according to the officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesmen for\u00a0ONGC,\u00a0HPCL, BPCL and the oil ministry declined to comment Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHPCL is relatively small and we do not expect that the merger will involve ONGC paying for the government stake in cash,\u201d according to Vikas Halan, vice president for corporate finance group at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrucial Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC, which\u00a0dominates India\u2019s upstream production, intends to spend 11 trillion rupees by 2030 to raise output. That spending plan is crucial for achieving\u00a0Modi\u2019s goal of cutting imports by 10 percent over the next five years. India imports about 80 percent of its crude oil.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC, which was India\u2019s most profitable company in the year ended March 2015, has seen its earnings erode along with the slump in crude oil prices and is headed for its lowest profit in nine years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped ONGC from investing in projects.\u00a0The company will spend $1.2 billion to acquire Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.\u2019s stake in a block on India\u2019s east coast. Last year it embarked\u00a0on a $5 billion development plan, its\u00a0biggest investment in a single project, in the Krishna-Godavari Basin off India\u2019s east coast. A significant portion of next fiscal year\u2019s capital-expenditure was earmarked for the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC expects to start gas output from the block\u00a0in the Bay of Bengal by mid-2019, Chairman Dinesh Kumar Sarraf said in June. It had initially planned to start producing gas from the\u00a0area in 2013.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a daunting task going ahead for ONGC,\u201d according to Dhaval Joshi, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. \u201cThey may have to rely on debt for future investments and curtail dividend payouts. That will be negative.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC Said to See Spending Plans Curtailed by Potential Merger\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-03-03 02:06:00"}
