{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.\u2019s minority shareholders stand to lose if the oil explorer pays a premium and takes on \u201cnoteable amount of debt\u201d to buy government\u2019s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., said CLSA.The brokerage house cited media reports suggesting that the government would demand a 40-50 percent premium on the stake sale. It had earlier said that ONGC could sell its 13.6 percent stake in another oil marketing company \u2013 Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. \u2013 to buy the stake.Another brokerage house Citi Research, in its research note, suggested that the country's largest oil and gas explorer would fund the deal by selling its stake in IOC. It ruled out a significant drag on ONGC's balance sheet.The Funding QuestionONGC will have to pay at least Rs 40,000 crore to buy out government\u2019s stake in HPCL, if the government demands a premium of 50 percent based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price. The acquirer had a cash reserve of Rs 16,648 crore as on March 31, 2017 and the upstream company holds 13.8 percent stake in IOC, which can be sold at more than Rs 26,000 crore, again based on Wednesday\u2019s closing price. Citi Research said the stake sale is a distinct possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling stake in IOC could preclude ONGC from having to significantly lever up for the acquisition, especially if the acquisition is at a meaningful premium to the market price.\n\nCiti Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake sale will be completed within the current financial year, said Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in an interview to Bloomberg in Istanbul on Wednesday.A buyout will also help the government edge closer to its divestment target of Rs 72,500 crore in the current financial year, with more than a third of the amount coming from a single deal.ONGC is the country\u2019s largest oil and gas explorer and supplied crude to refining companies like IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. and HPCL, among others. The company also has controlling stake in another refining company, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd., which has an installed capacity of 15 million tonnes per annum.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC-HPCL Deal And The Debt Conundrum\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-07-13 09:00:00"}
