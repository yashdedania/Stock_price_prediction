{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nOil & Natural Gas Corp Ltd.\u2019s (ONGC) quarterly profit declined 12 percent to Rs 4,352 crore after the company wrote off a higher percentage of exploration cost worth Rs 1,364.4 crore in the third quarter of financial year 2017.The company missed analyst estimates on the bottomline for the first time in six quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income of India\u2019s biggest energy explorer also missed analyst estimates by 10 percent. ONGC, however, beat revenue estimate 3 percent. Revenue increased 9 percent to Rs 19,934 crore, quarter-on-quarter, the New Delhi-headquartered company said in a statement to exchanges.The state-run explorer is key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s goal of increasing the nation\u2019s energy security and reducing import dependence by 10 percent over the next six years. Declining earnings will weigh on ONGC\u2019s plan to make more investments in exploration and development to boost flagging output from ageing fields. It could also hinder efforts to acquire assets in India and overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell one percent compared to the second quarter to come in at Rs 9,006 crore, while EBITDA margin contracted by 450 basis points to 45 percent.The exploration cost written off in the third quarter stood at Rs 1,364.4 crore, which was 149 percent higher than the previous quarter, resulting in the weakness seen in both bottomline and EBITDA.ONGC\u2019s board declared a second interim dividend of Rs 2.25 per share.
