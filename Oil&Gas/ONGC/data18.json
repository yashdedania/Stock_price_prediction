Other than raising debt, it has other option like using cash and stake sale in four listed companies. Shashi Shanker, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said that they will fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and stake sale and debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what the brokerages had to say:IDFC SecuritiesLower premium a key positive for ONGC.Price would set fair value benchmark for HPCL; positive for the stock.Expect Indian Oil Corp. to merge its subsidiary (CPCL), and/or buy government stake in Oil India.ONGC + HPCL to help price hedging objectives, but only partially.BOB Capital MarketsConsolidated debt/equity ratio to increase to only 0.4 times as against 0.2 times.Acquisition to give access to 26 percent RoCE business.Expect no merger or operational synergies as HPCL will be an independent entity.Motilal OswalWin-win for minority shareholders of both companies.Remain positive on both ONGC and HPCL.Consolidation to reduce volatility in earnings.CLSANegative for IOCL and GAIL (India) as ONGC might sell stake to fund this deal.Chance of similar deals in 12-24 months to be an overhang on IOCL and BPCL.HPCL\u2019s outperformance to peers may reverse now.ONGC\u2019s stock price should see a big relief rally.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        HPCL Deal To Be Earnings Accretive For ONGC, Brokerages Says\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-01-22 07:43:00"}
