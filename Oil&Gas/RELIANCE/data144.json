The size and other details of the deal have not been disclosed yet.The acquisition is \u201cpart of Reliance\u2019s efforts to enter the composites business\u201d and Kemrock's assets allow it to \u201cforay into new materials\u201d, the statement added. This will \u201cfurther strengthen its petrochemicals business portfolio\u201d, Reliance added.Carbon fibre has seen increasing interest from defence manufacturers, automakers and wind turbine makers for the material\u2019s strength, heat resistance and lightness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market for carbon fibre is expected to more than double to $4.7 billion in 2020 from $2.2 billion in 2015, according to Allied Market Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbani isn\u2019t the only Indian billionaire looking to take advantage of this rally though.
