{"text": "\n\n\n\nThe 2018 edition of Auto Expo showcased some 50 electric vehicles, reflecting the buzz created by the government\u2019s proclaimed intention to sell only electric cars by 2030, to both reduce vehicular pollution and curb India\u2019s dependence on petroleum product imports.The displays signalled the industry\u2019s capability and eagerness to tap this new market. Just 0.02 percent of all new cars sold in India in 2016 were electric. In contrast, as many as 2.5 million conventional cars are sold every year, and a matching sales figure for EVs hints at a huge market.Based on road transport minister Nitin Gadkari\u2019s announcement that a policy dedicated to promoting and regulating EVs was in the works, EV manufacturers and sellers were expecting a policy and regulatory framework laying out a roadmap for creating an ecosystem comprising, most importantly, charging stations, as well as rolling out incentives for both manufacturing and purchasing EVs.However, the day after the event ended, on Feb. 15, Gadkari seemed to reverse course. \u201cThere is no need for any policy now,\u201d Gadkari said. \u201cWhat we need is just action plans,\u201d said Amitabh Kant, chief executive of government think-tank NITI Aayog, explaining Gadkari\u2019s stand. \u201cEveryday, new technology is coming into the market. Technology is always ahead of rules and regulations. And in India, it becomes very tough to change rules and regulations, so let there be just actions.\u201dOn Feb. 16, the heavy industries ministry issued a draft National Auto Policy for discussion, acknowledging the importance of green mobility but referring to EVs as just one among several alternatives such as vehicles run on biofuels, CNG and hydrogen. No specific timelines for targets, infrastructure building and incentives for any of these were outlined, and, most worryingly for EV makers, no plans were specified for aligning India\u2019s flagship EV programme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles, with the overall electric vehicle vision or with the domestic manufacturing programme, Make in India.\u201cWe are trying to figure out what went wrong,\u201d an official from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles told IndiaSpend, requesting anonymity. SMEV represents Indian manufacturers of electric vehicles and component makers. A mandate guiding the switchover to EVs is definitely required to speed up production, he added.The government\u2019s volte-face created near panic among EV makers, and analysts agreed a dedicated policy was essential.\u201cThe country needs a clear road map with timelines and role play on transition to electric vehicles, else it will just remain a dream,\u201d said Amit Bhatt, strategy head for integrated urban transport at World Resources Institute India, a think-tank.EVs have the potential to disrupt the mobility ecosystem, Bhatt said, adding that if the transition is done well, it can positively influence employment generation and the wider economy, in addition to addressing two most pressing issues of our time\u2013air pollution and climate change.Here\u2019s a look at how the government can remove speed-breakers from the road to scale-up of EV production and uptake.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        0.02% New Cars Are Electric.
