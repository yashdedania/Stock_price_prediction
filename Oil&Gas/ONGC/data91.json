{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s domestic gas prices may stop falling for the first time two years, a welcome relief for the country\u2019s energy explorers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price for the April-September period will probably be set at $2.58 per million British thermal units,\u00a0near the current $2.50, according to the median of 10 responses in a Bloomberg survey of industry participants. The government sets the rate every six months and an announcement on the price is due next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas prices in India have more than halved after four successive cuts since\u00a0the formula was introduced in November 2014. That\u2019s squeezed margins of explorers such as\u00a0Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd., while benefiting users including fertilizer companies and power generators. The forecasts compiled by Bloomberg range from $2.50 to $2.70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGas prices globally are weak, which will reflect in the price revision from April 1,\u201d according to Harsh Dole, a Mumbai-based analyst at India Infoline Ltd. \u201cI don\u2019t expect gas prices to move up significantly anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ONGC, the country\u2019s biggest gas producer, every $1 change in the price impacts annual revenue by 42 billion rupees ($640 million) at the current rate of production, according to Director Finance A.K. Srinivasan. ONGC\u2019s\u00a0gas output in the 11-month period ended February was about 60 million cubic meters a day, more than 69 percent of the country\u2019s total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cONGC\u2019s average cost of production for all blocks put together is about $3.50,\u201d according to Vaibhav Chowdhry, an analyst at K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. \u201cThe low prices will continue to hamper their margins. They at least need a price of more than $3.50 to break even and recover their costs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government allows a higher tariff of about $5.30 per million Btu for gas recovered from some deep-water fields under a policy change to encourage companies to tap difficult deposits. That price is also due to be revised from April 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current gas-price formula is based on U.S., Canadian, U.K. and Russian rates. Reliance spokesman Tushar Pania and oil ministry spokesman Rahul Gowlikar didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India's ONGC, Reliance Seen Getting Relief From Gas Price Cuts\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-03-25 09:07:00"}
