{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nState-owned oil major Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. (ONGC) has said the preliminary discussion for its acquisition of India's third-biggest fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (HPCL) has started and is going on at the ministerial level.\"Talks are going on at the ministerial level. We have not discussed it at the ONGC board. The petroleum ministry wants this to happen because if integration takes place, there will be value creation,\" ONGC Director (onshore) Ved Prakash Mahawar told PTI.Asked about reports on valuation of the deal between ONGC and HPCL, he said, \"These are only guesses. So far, no discussion has taken place at our board meeting.\"Mahawar stressed that merger and acquisitions are strategic decisions of the company and the talks to acquire HPCL are at a preliminary stage at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Pros And Cons Of ONGC Acquiring Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked specifically if any proposal has been prepared to discuss the issue at the ONGC board, he said, \"We have not talked about it yet.\"According to Mahawar, the merger will create value for shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have MRPL (Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd), which does not have retail outlets. If we do a vertical integration of HPCL, then we will take MRPL\u2019s products to retail outlets. We will get the margin of retail outlets as well which we are not getting now.\n\nVed Prakash Mahawar, Director, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, a source had said India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC may buy all of the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL, which will have to be followed by an open offer to acquire additional 26 percent from other shareholders of the retailer.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.ONGC is already the majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15-million-tonne refinery.The merger is likely to help the world's third-largest oil consumer better compete with global majors in acquiring foreign assets.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Merger Talks Of ONGC, HPCL On At Ministerial Level\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-03-15 10:42:00"}
