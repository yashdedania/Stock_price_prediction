{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- When Apple Inc. dropped Imagination Technologies Group Plc as a supplier for iPhone technology, the British chip designer\u2019s shares plunged as much as 69 percent and the company ultimately accepted a buyout. But the U.K.\u2019s Dialog Semiconductor Plc, which relies on Apple for about three-quarters of its revenue, isn\u2019t worried.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing strong third-quarter earnings, Dialog Chief Executive Officer Jalal Bagherli dismissed concerns Tuesday, saying his company and Imagination have little in common other than sharing similar customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf someone were to not use us they\u2019d have to create 1,000 highly-skilled power management engineers to really replicate what we do,\u201d Bagherli said in an interview. He said this is in contrast to Imagination, which designs technology for customers to manufacture themselves, rather than being a supplier of usable components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semiconductor industry has seen much consolidation over the past two years and the U.K. has been a notable target. In addition to Imagination\u2019s sale, U.K. chip designer ARM\u00a0Holdings Plc was snapped up by SoftBank Group Corp. for $32 billion. Elsewhere, Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV is the target of what was once the industry\u2019s biggest-ever deal when Qualcomm Inc. proposed a $47 billion buyout in November last year. Qualcomm itself this week received an unsolicited $105 billion bid from Broadcom Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBagherli doesn\u2019t see the latter acquisition posing a significant threat to Dialog. \u201cThey\u2019re primarily digital companies so really they\u2019re not in areas where they impact our business directly,\u201d he said of Qualcomm and Broadcom. \u201cIf they pull that off it creates a very large semiconductor company that competes at a much more significant level with established players like Intel Corp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO also said his company\u2019s $276 million acquisition of U.S. startup Silego Technology Inc. was completed on Nov. 1, and is forecast to grow 15 percent next year as Dialog makes a bigger push into the connected devices, or \u201cInternet of Things\u201d market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom a diversification point of view, our strategy is working,\u201d Bagherli said when asked about the risk of having one customer account for as much as 74 percent of its revenue. \u201cOur investment in Bluetooth connectivity is going through the roof, and now we added Silego, which is a unique technology pillar we can offer to a range of customers rather than a single customer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone X\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBagherli wouldn\u2019t mention his company\u2019s biggest customer by name, nor did he mention the iPhone X directly. But he did suggest some reports that the California-based company had cut orders of components for its new flagship smartphone were either inaccurate or irrelevant to Dialog\u2019s business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the company\u2019s third-quarter\u00a0revenue of $363 million was 2 percent above the midpoint of guidance issued in July. \u201cIf it was really halved or doubled,\u201d Bagherli said of iPhone component orders, \u201cwe would have really underperformed on our guidance massively, or overperformed massively.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to predict the extent of the popularity but everything we see is positive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a strong backlog and hence we are guiding towards being 19 percent up year-on-year in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Dialog reported revenue that met the average analyst estimate, with adjusted operating profit of $76.6 million. It sees fourth-quarter revenue of $415 million to $455 million, with a strong backlog of orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance on Apple Is No Threat to U.K.'s Dialog, CEO Says\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-07 09:17:00"}
