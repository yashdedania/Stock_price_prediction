{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Communications Ltd., the embattled mobile phone operator controlled by Anil Ambani, slid to record lows in the stock and bond market Monday after saying over the weekend that it missed local debt interest payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s stock fell by as much as 14 percent to its lowest ever. Its dollar bond due 2020 dropped 1.3 cents to a record low of 35.9 cents on the dollar as of 1:10 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to Bloomberg-compiled prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications is battling for survival amid a shakeout in the world\u2019s second-largest telecom market, and failed to pay interest on both international and local bonds this month. A grace period ends Monday on a $9.75 million interest payment that was due Nov. 6 for its 2020 dollar notes, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The company said\u00a0on Saturday that\u00a0it also missed payments due in November on two rupee-denominated securities and that it is in a standstill period for interest and principal repayments until December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntense price competition has driven down earnings as larger mobile companies vie for market share. Reliance Communication reported a net loss of 27.1 billion rupees ($415 million) for the quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Communications Bonds and Stocks Tumble to Record Lows\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-14 08:36:00"}
