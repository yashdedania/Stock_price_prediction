["\n\n\n\nThe Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.\u2019s acquisition of 51 percent stake in public sector refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. to help the government meet its divestment target isn\u2019t the first-of-its-kind deal.In 16 years through March 2014, India has sold a stake in public sector companies to other state-run peers 11 times to raise Rs 14,700 crore, according to data on BSEPSU. The last time that happened was in 2013-14 when the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power. ONGC and Oil India Ltd. had then acquired 10 percent of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. for Rs 5,340 crore\u2014about a fifth of the earnings through selloff that year.Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram had tweeted that the ONGC-HPCL deal nullified the government\u2019s decision to lower its excess borrowing in 2017-18 as India\u2019s largest refiner would borrow Rs 30,000 crore to part-fund the buyout. He didn\u2019t question the transaction as such.India has used this route to meet its divestment target, where the money is going from one pocket to another, Pranav Haldea, managing director of Prime Database, which provides information of capital markets, told BloombergQuint. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t essentially mean divestment. This is just a way to shore up revenue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 20, ONGC said it will acquire the government\u2019s 51 percent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore as India took the first step to create a state-run oil behemoth to compete with global rivals. The deal contributed more than half of the divestment target. Against the budgeted Rs 72,500 crore, it will earn Rs 92,475 crore once the deal is completed by the end of this month.The government has been using this route to raise funds since 1998. ONGC bought its 12.66 percent stake in IOC, while IOC bought 15.7 percent in ONGC between 1998 and 2000, according to the data. In 2001-02, the government sold its 74 percent stake in IBP Co Ltd. to IOC for Rs 1,154 crore. That year, the actual proceeds from selloff were Rs 3,646 crore.Haldea said real divestment is when the government sells a stake in the primary or secondary markets. \u201cWe have seen several initial public offerings and offer for sales state-owned companies. That should be preferred route of divestment.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s domestic gas prices may stop falling for the first time two years, a welcome relief for the country\u2019s energy explorers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price for the April-September period will probably be set at $2.58 per million British thermal units,\u00a0near the current $2.50, according to the median of 10 responses in a Bloomberg survey of industry participants. The government sets the rate every six months and an announcement on the price is due next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas prices in India have more than halved after four successive cuts since\u00a0the formula was introduced in November 2014. That\u2019s squeezed margins of explorers such as\u00a0Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries Ltd., while benefiting users including fertilizer companies and power generators. The forecasts compiled by Bloomberg range from $2.50 to $2.70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGas prices globally are weak, which will reflect in the price revision from April 1,\u201d according to Harsh Dole, a Mumbai-based analyst at India Infoline Ltd. \u201cI don\u2019t expect gas prices to move up significantly anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ONGC, the country\u2019s biggest gas producer, every $1 change in the price impacts annual revenue by 42 billion rupees ($640 million) at the current rate of production, according to Director Finance A.K. Srinivasan. ONGC\u2019s\u00a0gas output in the 11-month period ended February was about 60 million cubic meters a day, more than 69 percent of the country\u2019s total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cONGC\u2019s average cost of production for all blocks put together is about $3.50,\u201d according to Vaibhav Chowdhry, an analyst at K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. \u201cThe low prices will continue to hamper their margins. They at least need a price of more than $3.50 to break even and recover their costs.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government allows a higher tariff of about $5.30 per million Btu for gas recovered from some deep-water fields under a policy change to encourage companies to tap difficult deposits. That price is also due to be revised from April 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current gas-price formula is based on U.S., Canadian, U.K. and Russian rates.

The Board of Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. (ONGC) at its meeting on September 8 approved signing of an MoU for taking a stake in Gujarat Petroleum Corp Ltd.\u2019s (GSPC) difficult gas block, sources privy to the development said. The MoU approved strangely also incorporates a dispute resolution wherein any differences over issues like valuation or natural gas reserves would be referred to a three-member committee of outside experts.Sources said this is perhaps for the first time that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) sets out a dispute resolution committee and it perhaps is indication of the pitfalls that ONGC anticipates in buying a stake in the block. It has already differed with GSPC on the gas reserves the block holds and has appointed US-based consultant Ryder Scott to do an independent assessment.The three member committee will have economist and former oil secretary Vijay Kelkar and former CVC P Shankar, they said adding the third member will be appointed in due course. Once all the three members are in place, the MoU will be inked, the sources added.Since the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre, the Gujarat government firm GSPC has been seeking to sell a majority stake in its KG-OSN-2001/3 (Deendayal) block in Bay of Bengal to ONGC to avoid defaulting on loans. ONGC initially was not keen to buy stake in the block as it felt the block had reserves far less than what GSPC was claiming and the asking price for the stake was not commensurate with the returns. But it has now agreed to look at the possibility and the MoU is a step further in that direction, they said.Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants has been asked to evaluate gas properties in the GSPC block and independently certify the reserves quantities, the source said. GSPC was to begin gas production from the block in 2013 but after sinking in USD 3.6 billion it was found that gas reserves are one-tenth of 20 trillion cubic feet claimed in 2005 and that too is technically difficult to produce. In the process it has amassed Rs 19,576 crore of debt, on which interest cost was Rs 1,804.06 crore in 2014-15, according to the CAG. And against this its revenue was Rs 152.51 crore in 2014-15.Sources said GSPC has been doing trial production of a very small volume of gas from August 4, 2014 and has not yet reached commercial production and in absence of revenue commensurate with the debt servicing obligations it risks becoming a defaulter. To bail out of the situation, it offered to sell 50 per cent stake to ONGC, they said.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nRising crude prices have made Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. the best bet among oil explorers in Asia.That\u2019s Macquarie Research\u2019s forecast for India\u2019s largest energy company.

The proportion of gas is expected to rise from 45 percent to 58 percent during the period, according to the brokerage.HPCL OverhangONGC\u2019s shares have underperformed partly because of lack of clarity in the acquisition price of government\u2019s stake in oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

Officials of the petroleum and natural gas ministry, state government, ONGC and Oil India had met on Friday to thrash out the pact, the minutes of which were submitted in the apex court.Citing its records in the meeting, the state government had claimed a royalty of around Rs 6,820 crore. According to the final agreement, ONGC is liable to pay Assam Rs 1,350 crore and Oil India Rs 4,973 crore. The Centre will make the payout on behalf of the two companies.A bench presided by Justices J Chelameswar and S Abdul Nazeer recorded the statement of agreement.The apex court had on Monday disposed of a similar case between ONGC and the Gujarat government involving a royalty payment of Rs 8,392 crore, after the Centre agreed to foot the bill.The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Act of 1948 mandates oil producers to pay 20 percent of the market value of crude they extract as royalty to the state where oil blocks are located.The Centre had said in 2003 that the burden of lower recovery because of subsidy offered on diesel, kerosene and LPG to consumers be shared by all the stakeholders and not oil marketing companies (OMCs) alone. It directed upstream companies, including ONGC, to sell crude to the OMCs at a discounted rate.From 2008, ONGC started paying royalty to state governments on the net or actual price realised from refiners after factoring in fuel subsidy discounts, leading to a dispute.In 2013, the Gujarat high court had directed ONGC to pay royalty to the state on the gross bill price of crude.The Supreme Court later directed ONGC to pay royalty to Gujarat at a pre-discount rate on February 1, 2014.

We have sought special pricing dispensation,\u201d he said.The BJP-led government in October 2014 had evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the U.S., Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile prices have halved to $2.89 since the formula was implemented, the government has allowed a higher rate of $6.3 per mmBtu for gas fields in difficult areas like deep sea.The official said the Krishna Godavari basin block KG- OWN-2004/1 is in shallow water and does not qualify as a 'difficult field'. On the western side, the block GK-28 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC\u2019s Deepest Gas Find Hits Regulatory Hurdle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the KG block will produce a peak output of 5.35 million standard cubic meters per day, the same from Gulf of Kutch block will be around 3 million metric standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd). It would take a minimum three years to bring the gas finds to production.The combined output is about 14 percent of the ONGC's current output of 60 mmscmd.\"If we don't get the right price, it will not be possible for us to develop the two projects. If we are forced to do so, it would be like putting in huge amount of money without expecting the same to return,\" the official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the KG block discoveries are in water depth of just about 8-meters, developing which is costly since ultra- shallow rigs are scarce and therefore expensive.ONGC also has a couple of smaller fields with a total expected peak production of 1.1 mmscmd, which cannot viably produce at the current domestic gas prices.The official said the company was in the process of preparing field development plans for all these fields but will go slow if the prices are not viable.For more than a year now, ONGC has been petitioning the oil ministry for setting a floor price of at least $4.2 per mmBtu for domestically produced natural gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new formula provides for revising rates every six months -- on April 1 and October 1, based on one-year average gas price in the surplus nations with a lag of one quarter. When the formula was implemented, rates went up from $4.2 to $5.05 per mmBtu but fell to $4.66 per mmBtu in April 2015 and to $3.82 in October that year.In 2016, the prices further dipped to $3.06 per mmBtu in April and to $2.50 per mmBtu in October. In April this year, they fell further to $2.48 but have from October 2017 risen to $2.89.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on March 20, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 to $7.30 per mmBtu. The same for other basins is in the range of $3.80 to $6.59 per mmBtu, he had said, adding the production costs of companies vary from field to field depending upon the size of the reservoir, location, logistics and availability of surface facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance, BP Submit Revised Investment Plan For KG-D6 Gas Finds\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe combined market valuation of nine of top 10 valued companies surged Rs 97,931.85 crore last week, with TCS Ltd. and Reliance Industries Ltd. leading the pack with maximum gains.HDFC Bank Ltd., ITC Ltd., Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and ONGC Ltd. were among the companies that registered gains in their respective market capitalisations during the week to Thursday.

(ONGC), a move that may potentially render its investments in oil and gas fields abroad infructuous. ONGC Videsh Ltd. (OVL) has stakes in 37 oil and gas projects in 17 countries around the world. These stakes are held through subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures. For operations of these projects, those units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL, which would transmit the investments.\nThe Service Tax Department now contends that the overseas units are rendering a service to OVL and as such the company is liable to pay service tax at the full rate, sources said. The department first issued a demand cum show-cause notice on October 11, 2011 requiring OVL to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 2,816.31 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered.\nThe tax amount was calculated based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the company\u2019s financial statements covering period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. Subsequently, five more demand-cum-show cause notices were issued covering period up to March 31, 2015 to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 3,286.36 crore, the interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the company. The Service Tax Department, sources said, has contended that the expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by the company\u2019s foreign branches and operator of joint venture/consortium to the company.\nOVL however has contended that service tax is not payable and is contesting the same legally. According to OVL, investments made overseas through subsidiaries or branches or joint ventures do not constitute availing of any service.\nThe company operates the projects at an internal rate of return on investments of 12-13 percent and if it has to pay 14-15 percent service tax on such investments, the projects will give negative returns and would become infructuous.\nAlso, it contends that service tax by law can be levied on services rendered within the country. And even if one were to assume that its branches or subsidiaries were rendering any service, they were all overseas and not within India and so cannot be subject to any service tax, sources said. OVL had reported a net loss of Rs 2,093.5 crore in 2015- 16 fiscal on a turnover of Rs 12,772 crore. It had a net profit of Rs 1,904.2 crore on a turnover of Rs 19,148.9 crore in the previous fiscal.\nIt produced 8.916 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 as compared to 8.874 million tonnes in the previous year. The overall gas production slightly increased from 3.341 billion cubic meters during 2014-15 to 3.406 bcm in 2015-16 and oil production was almost flat at 5.51 million tonnes.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) by Indian companies in their overseas ventures jumped over two-fold to $2.99 billion last month.Indian firms had made investments of $1.42 billion in their overseas joint ventures/subsidiaries in March 2016.Investments in March this year were much higher than the preceding month.

Under OAL, companies can carve out any area that is currently not under any licensee, and evince interest for doing exploration and production. Once an area is selected, the government will put it up for bidding and any firm offering the maximum share of oil or gas produced from the area would be awarded the block.Till now, the government has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.So far, 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000.

What happens if the resolution is defeated? Does the company have a plan in place to rollback the transaction in case the resolution is defeated?\u201d asked IiAS.Both the Companies Act and SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 exempt public-sector undertakings from seeking shareholder approval where the RPTs are conducted with another PSU. But there are no such exemptions for transactions between the government and a PSU.\u201cDespite this, SEBI, vide its letter dated November 30, 2017, has already granted exemption to ONGC from having to take shareholders\u2019 approval. ONGC has also applied to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs for an exemption \u2013 once granted the current resolution (seeking shareholder nod) will be withdrawn. IiAS believes this renders otiose the entire exercise,\u201d the note said.IiAS said that discerning shareholders who have taken the time and effort to analyse and vote will be left in the lurch if the resolution were to be withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: India's ONGC Is Said to Expect Delays in Its Biggest Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt went on to ask if ONGC should be given preferential treatment, thereby avoiding the shareholder voting process.Stating that PSU shareholders have expectations regarding governance standards, it said that the current legal framework fails to provide a level playing field.\u201cThe government is often able to push its agenda forward, which might not always be in the best interests of the company\u2019s direct and immediate stakeholders,\u201d it said.The advisory firm said there is a need for greater introspection across the board. \u201cIn the listed space, there cannot be different standards for PSUs and private companies.

(ONGC) may acquire India's third-biggest fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) in an about Rs 44,000 crore ($6.6 billion) deal as part of the government's plan to create an integrated oil giant.Following up on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's 2017-18 Budget announcement of creating an integrated oil company, India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC may buy all of the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL.This will have to be followed by an open offer to acquire additional 26 percent from other shareholders of HPCL.\"The government is looking at creating an integrated oil company and the idea is to merge an oil producer with a refiner,\" said one person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Pros And Cons Of ONGC Acquiring Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are only six major companies in the sector \u2013 ONGC and Oil India Ltd.

The rest such as ONGC Videsh, Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (CPCL), Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) are already subsidiaries of one of these six PSUs.\"So, the options are very limited. One option is to merge refiners HPCL and BPCL with ONGC and merge IOC and OIL. Now this would create two large vertically integrated oil companies. But this would also mean limiting the choice for consumers to just two companies for buying fuel,\" the person said.The possible way out is to merge HPCL with ONGC while keeping BPCL separate. BPCL already has a flourishing upstream arm in Bharat PetroResources Ltd which can be strengthened further.\"This way consumers will continue to have three fuel retailers in IOC, ONGC-HPCL combine and BPCL,\" he said.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries. ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15-mt refinery.The person said ONGC buying HPCL will require two sets of Cabinet approval - one where the government approves sale of its all or part of its 51.11 percent stake to ONGC, and the other for allowing ONGC to spend the money on stake buy. Considering Monday's trading price of Rs 561, ONGC will have to pay the government Rs 29,128 crore for 51.11 percent stake. It will then have to buy another 26 percent from the open market for Rs 14,817 crore, taking the total acquisition price to about Rs 44,000 crore. The merger will help the world's third-largest oil consumer better compete with global majors in acquiring foreign assets.More than 12 years after a proposal to merge oil PSUs was first mooted by the then oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, Jaitley in his Budget for 2017-18 proposed to \"create an integrated public sector 'oil major' which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies\".The behemoth so created will not just compete globally, but withstand oil price volatility by using profits the refining business make in low oil prices to make up for losses in upstream and vice versa.\"We seek opportunities to strengthen our central public sector enterprises through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions,\" Jaitley had told the Lok Sabha on February 1 while presenting the Budget for the year beginning April 1.\"It will give them the capacity to bear high risk, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decision and create more value for stakeholders.\"Aiyar had first mooted merger of HPCL and BPCL with ONGC and OIL with IOC to create two oil giants having interests across the energy chain in 2004.However, in September 2015, a high-level panel on recast of public sector oil firms did not favour mergers to create behemoths and instead suggested greater autonomy by transferring government shareholding in oil PSUs to a professionally-managed trust.The Advisory Committee on Synergy in Energy headed by V Krishnamurthy was of the view that mergers and consolidations worldwide occurred during times of low oil prices and were instruments of eliminating excess workforce and duplicate facilities.That was the time when oil price was on the rise, but it has in the past two years slumped to multi-year lows.Aiyar was also keen on subsidiaries of oil PSUs to be merged with the parent firm - like merger of Kochi refinery with BPCL and Chennai refinery with IOC.ONGC is India's biggest oil and gas producer and the highest profit-making company. IOC is the country's biggest refiner while GAIL is India's largest gas pipeline operator.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange, an early indicator of Nifty\u2019s performance in India, gained 0.35 percent to 8,606.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the stocks to watch out for in today\u2019s session:\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nRs 366 crore order includes supply of material for overhauling of 18 power turbines. \u2018Zero Hour Overhaul\u2019 will enable turbines to run 1,00,000 hours before the next overhaul.Siemens stock rose 1.13 percent to Rs 1,177 as of 9:35 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiemens Ltd. said it had won an order worth about Rs 366 crore from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.

The stake is currently held by Gujarat government-owned Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. On the face of it, the transaction value is lower than GSPC\u2019s investment in the field, but it\u2019s not quite the steal it looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Deal Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe KG block comprises nine gas discoveries \u2013 three in the south-western area, commonly known as Deen Dayal West (DDW), and six others. The three discoveries in DDW have been under trial production since August 2014, while for the remaining six GSPC has been working to finalise an investment plan and bring them to production, according the company\u2019s annual report for financial year 2016.The approved field development plan suggests that the gas in place for the three DDW fields is approximately 1.952 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which only 1.0596 tcf is producible. The gas in place for the remaining six discoveries in the KG basin is still not known.ONGC has acquired the three discoveries in DDW for $995.26 million (Rs 6,750 crore) and will pay another $200 million (Rs 1,356 crore) as advance for the six other discoveries.Along with the balance payable to GSPC, ONGC will also have to bear the development costs of these six discoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides GSPC\u2019s 80 percent stake, two private companies, Jubilant Enpro and Geo Global Resources, own 10 percent each in the nine discoveries. According to an audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India published in March 2016, the consortium (of GSPC, Jubilant Enpro and Geo Global) had invested Rs 17,025 crore in the DDW fields, of which GSPC\u2019s investment works out to Rs 13,620 crore. GSPC is yet to respond to BloombergQuint\u2019s query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC In Deep Water?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt approximately Rs 6,750 crore, ONGC has acquired the three DDW gas fields at a price much lower than GSPC\u2019s Rs 13,620 crore investment in the fields.But the merits of this acquisition as well as the purchase of majority interest in the additional six fields are unclear, due to non-stabilisation of production and unresolved technical issues in the acquired fields, says brokerage firm Kotak Securities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe remain cautious on the acquisition given techno-commercial challenges and uncertainty on future prospects, even as the acquisition price seems to be lower than the amount invested by GSPC in the block.\n\nKotak Securities Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC, in its media statement, justifies the consideration paid to GSPC for the three DDW fields on the grounds that the fields have developed infrastructure such as well head platforms, an export pipeline and an onshore gas terminal.But despite this infrastructure there is no commercial production of gas, even though it was slated to have begun in December 2011. Moreover, they are deepwater fields, generally considered to be technologically challenging and the kind in which ONGC has little experience.Considering these uncertainties and current energy prices, ONGC\u2019s multi-million-dollar acquisition may fail to deliver positive returns, says the Kotak report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our view, the continued uncertainty around production amid time and cost overruns may put to risk the economic viability even at government\u2019s approved ceiling price for difficult fields.\n\nKotak Securities Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the gas price ceiling notified by government for difficult fields stands at $5.3 per million British Thermal Unit and even the CAG report doubts the financial viability of the project at gas prices below $5.7 per MMBtu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact remained that prices were below the FDP (field development plan) estimate of $5.70/MMBtu based on which the project was considered as financially viable. Thus the viability of the project even after commercial production of gas is doubtful. \n\nComptroller & Auditor General of India\u2019s Audit Report (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Reliance Industries sold a 30 percent stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, including blocks in the KG basin, to British Petroleum PLC. for $7.2 billion. At the time, BP had estimated the gas resources of the fields at 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf), of which BP\u2019s share would be 4.5 tcf.The Reliance-BP deal is not quite comparable with the ONGC-GSPC acquisition because most of Reliance\u2019s blocks had begun commercial production at the time of BP\u2019s purchase, whereas only trial production is on at the three DDW fields. Yet, it\u2019s useful to know that BP paid approximately $1.6 billion per 1 tcf of gas in running fields, whereas ONGC is paying $995.26 for 0.8 tcf of gas in fields yet to start production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho Gains?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWire agency PTI in a recent news report quoted sources as saying that GSPC has since 2014 been seeking to sell its stake and operatorship in these assets to ONGC, to avoid defaulting on loans. The report says that ONGC was initially not keen on the deal as it believed the block had reserves far less than what GSPC was claiming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSPC has made large upstream investments mainly via borrowings and that has stressed the company\u2019s financials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, GSPC\u2019s consolidated debt stands at Rs 28,900 crore and the annual interest outflow at Rs 1,885 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling the fields to ONGC will help GSPC raise money to repay debt, but it will also lead to a significant net worth erosion, as the stake is being sold for Rs 6,750 crore against a book value of Rs 13,620 crore. This will result in large carry-forward losses and GSPC may or may not pay tax for the next many years as it writes these off.On the other hand, ONGC\u2019s cash balance will take a 63 percent hit, dropping to Rs 4,800 crore, for an acquisition that may not add any value or at the least will be challenging to monetise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see limited merit in ONGC\u2019s strategy of acquiring discovered/under-developed assets.

The company still needs to add more than 7 million tons to achieve its target of 20 million tons by 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cShort-term production goals can only be achieved through producing assets because the exploration life cycle is very long,\u201d Managing Director Narendra Kumar Verma said in an interview last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are focusing on producing assets to boost production in short term.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent ONGC\u2019s shares rose as much as 2 percent to 197.25 rupees and traded 1.3 percent higher\u00a0at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday in Mumbai. They were the top performer on the benchmark Sensex, which was up 0.1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing India\u2019s energy companies to raise domestic output and secure assets overseas to bolster energy security for a country that imports more than 80 percent of its oil. Adding supplies through the purchase of producing assets is a faster, and potentially more-costly, alternative to exploring and developing new fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC Videsh, the nation\u2019s largest overseas oil and gas investor, is struggling to reverse declining output from Russian unit Imperial Energy Corp., which it acquired in 2008, revive assets in troubled Sudan and Syria, raise production in Venezuela and start pumping from Mozambique.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company bought a 26 percent stake in Russia\u2019s Vankor project last year from oil giant Rosneft, lifting its overall output to about 12.8 million tons in the year ended March 31, from 8.92 million in the previous year. The company expects total output to reach 14 million tons by March, with half of that coming from Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRussia has been giving us good opportunities, and our governments share good relations,\u201d Verma said. The company is working toward a more diversified portfolio, he said, \u201cbut if a good opportunity emerges again in Russia, we will not hesitate.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oil price crash that started in 2014 helped the company bulk up on assets that have been in production for years. Global benchmark Brent oil, which hit the lowest in more than a decade during January 2016, has recovered to about $65 a barrel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDefinitely the low oil price has offered a window of opportunity for us to consolidate and increase our footprint,\u201d Verma said. \u201cGradually, people are reconciling with the low prices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nTraders continued to unwind previous positions in the futures contracts of India\u2019s major equity indices despite the Nifty 50 and the Bank Nifty closing flat.

The Nifty Put Call Ratio, which is the total open interest in Nifty put options to that of call options, increased marginally to 1.21 from 1.22. This measure reflects the number of calls written in comparison to puts in the Nifty.While the Nifty remained flat, most activity was witnessed in the 9,800, 9,650 call options which added 3 lakh and 2.4 lakh shares respectively in open interest and the 9,600 put which shed 11 lakh shares in open interest.

However, India's import dependence has since only risen to 81 percent.While output as well as investments by private firms have all but dried up, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan sees raising production from fields given to state-run firms on nomination basis, or without bidding, as key to achieving the target.On May 25, the ministry asked the all-powerful review committees headed by its upstream technical arm DGH, to monitor performance of ONGC and Oil India. The panels will review aspects ranging from the annual work programme and budget to declaration of a discovery as commercial, reservoir and production performance, monitoring of development activities and collaborations with other explorers.\"The advice/decision of the Review Committee shall be implemented forthwith by the NOC (national oil company) concerned and the progress of implementation shall be reported to the Review Committee through DGH at its next meeting,\" the order issued by Atanu Chakraborty, Director General, DGH, said.DGH followed it up with a June 21 order asking NOCs to submit \"at the end of each day, data relating to Daily Production for each field\" as well as on second day of every month \"the provisional Production Data for the preceding month\" and \"the Reconciled Monthly Production Data for each month on or before the tenth day of the following month.\" In a July 11 order, it asked the NOCs to reservoir production and performance data on a half-yearly basis and in-place reserves in each of the fields on a yearly basis.Besides seeking all technical data on reservoir performance, it asked NOCs to immediately notify any discovery and detailed timelines for subsequent processes like declaring a find commercially viable and submission of a field development plan.\"If the NOC declares the discovery a commercial discovery, then within 200 days (for oil) and 365 days (for gas), the NOC shall submit to DGH for the purpose of review and advice by the Review Committee, a comprehensive Field Development Plan (FDP)/Feasibility Report (FR),\" the July 11 order said.For previous discoveries, it wanted a quarterly status report.ONGC produced 86 percent of its 26.13 million tonnes of crude oil in 2016-17 fiscal from fields given to it on nomination basis. Natural gas production from nomination fields accounted for 93 percent of the total output of 25.34 billion cubic meters.Pradhan had at an industry event last month stated that oil recovery from reservoirs internationally is 35-40 percent and that for gas is 55-70 percent.\"In India, the current recovery factors of ONGC and Oil India for crude oil are as low as 27 percent and 23 percent.In case of natural gas, it is 54 percent and 43 percent for ONGC and Oil India, respectively,\" he had said.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nA tough year looms ahead for India\u2019s oil and gas sector as a demand-supply mismatch and geopolitical uncertainties will likely keep the price of Brent crude elevated.Oil prices will hold the gains made in late 2017 and Brent will rise to $63 amid robust demand, supply curbs from Russia, geopolitical uncertainities and the upcoming general elections in 2019, investment banking firm Jefferies said in a report.Rising oil prices may hit corporate earnings in the sector, especially for downstream companies, the report said.

TCS and RIL are followed by HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC, SBI, HUL, Maruti, Infosys and ONGC in the list.The market cap figure changes daily with the stock price movement.

(HPCL) through sale of its minority stake in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOC) and GAIL India Ltd., S&P Global Ratings said today.The rating agency said that the Indian government's approval to sell its majority 51.11 percent stake in HPCL to ONGC is likely to be credit neutral for the state explorer.It, however, did not see much benefit in combining HPCL's downstream oil refining and fuel marketing business with ONGC's oil and gas production.\"We do not expect any significant synergy between ONGC's upstream operations and HPCL's downstream operations although it will provide some diversity. Also, a complete merger of ONGC and HPCL is unlikely because we believe that they will have significant challenges in integrating the people, systems, and corporate culture,\" it said in a statement.ONGC has a 71.63 percent stake in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd., which has a capacity of 15 million tonne per year. Combining this with HPCL's similar refining capacity and about 15,000 fuel retail stations could help derive some procurement benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC To Not Make Open Offer Post-HPCL Acquisition: Government Official\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P said if ONGC exercises the option of divesting its minority stakes in other state-run oil and gas companies to fund the acquisition of the HPCL stake, ONGC's financial metrics will be largely unchanged. However, using debt to fund the HPCL stake will put pressure on ONGC's stand-alone credit profile.S&P said the deal could take six months to complete and ONGC would be able to secure the necessary approval from the government and regulatory bodies to avoid triggering a mandatory open offer to buy an additional 26 percent stake in HPCL from the public.ONGC's financial ratios, it said, will remain largely unchanged if it funds the HPCL stake purchase by selling its stakes in IOC and GAIL.\"We expect ONGC's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to remain at 35-40 percent over the next two to three years post the proposed transaction,\" it said.ONGC has 13.77 percent stake in IOC, valued at Rs 25,400 crore and 4.87 percent stake in GAIL, valued at Rs 3,100 crore.\"We believe ONGC -- with the required approvals -- can sell these stakes in the open market to fund the HPCL deal.However, the divestment may be gradual and ONGC could meanwhile fund the HPCL stake purchase using a bridge loan,\" it said.The rating agency said if ONGC funds the deal with debt of about $4.5 billion, the company's FFO-to-debt ratio to trend towards 30 percent -- below the trigger for a lower assessment of rating -- potentially resulting in at least a one notch lower.In addition, if ONGC makes an open offer for the additional 26 percent stake, the company will need to pay out a further Rs 14,500 crore, potentially resulting in a lower rating assessment by two notches.The deal is a part of the government's announcement to create an integrated national oil major by combining several of its state-owned oil and gas companies.\"However, we believe the government's intention may be to have a few large integrated oil companies instead of one big integrated national oil major. Still, such combined entities will be small in comparison to global oil majors,\" it said.Combining HPCL will improve ONGC's cash flow stability and operating scale to an extent. However, there will be no material change in ONGC's business risk profile.This is because HPCL's pre-tax profit is relatively modest -- about 25 percent of ONGC's. HPCL will remain a majority-owned subsidiary of ONGC.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange, an early indicator of Nifty\u2019s performance in India, fell 0.4 percent to 7,964.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Monday morning briefing. https://t.co/pXw5aHgP0e pic.twitter.com/5EyoCTtRVP\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) December 26, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the stocks to watch in today\u2019s sessionReliance Capital: Unit Reliance Home Finance NCDs public issue gets 3.12 times demandONGC to pay $1.2 billion for GSPC\u2019s gas block in Krishna Godavari BasinApar Industries: To consider buy back of its shares on Jan. 6Bajaj Hindusthan: Says expects power business sale to be completed by MarchJK Tyres: To consider raising funds via securities on Dec. 28IDFC Bank: Starts nationwide Aadhaar cashless payments to merchantsKotak Mahindra Bank: Says no fake accounts in any branch and full cooperation with investigatorsEssel Propack: To raise Rs 20 crore selling commercial paperGayatri Projects: To consider stock-splitIgarashi Motors: To consider absorbing units, re-organisationTata Chemicals: Shareholders vote to remove Wadia as director\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nIndian shares extended their gains for a third day led by banks as chances of an early U.S. Fed rate hike diminish.

Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investment could help Saudi Aramco strengthen its hand in the world\u2019s largest oil consuming region as it prepares for what may be the biggest-ever initial public offering. India\u2019s per capita consumption of polymer products, which is about a third of the global average, is expected to expand as a growing middle class, increasing income levels and higher urbanization drive growth, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said last month while inaugurating OPaL\u2019s plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s petrochemical business is booming and Aramco will definitely want to be a part of this growth,\u201d said Vaibhav Chowdhry, an analyst at KR Choksey Shares & Securities Pvt. The country\u2019s petrochemical market is expected to grow as fast as 12 percent annually for next several years, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil & Natural Gas Corp., which owns the biggest stake in OPaL, entered into a preliminary cooperation agreement\u00a0in January 2014 with Petrochemical Industries Co., a subsidiary of state-owned Kuwait Petroleum. Talks between OPaL and PIC about the Kuwaiti company investing in the Indian project stalled last year, according to the people.

Reliance invested about $19 billion to double the capacity of its petrochemicals unit, while Indian Oil will spend $4.6 billion to add new facilities and expand existing units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Aramco, which is the biggest supplier of crude oil to India, has shown interest in a proposed 60 million tons-a-year refinery and petrochemicals project being planned by Indian state refiners on the nation\u2019s west coast, India\u2019s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on March 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Saudi oil major has already invested in integrated refining, chemicals, marketing and distribution companies in the region.

After the completion of the buyout, HPCL will be merged with MRPL, ONGC Chairman DK Sarraf told BloombergQuint over the phone. \"There would be synergies between HPCL and MRPL in consolidation of the two,\u201d he added.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you give us some clarity on whether the acquisition of HPCL will be done via cash or stock of ONGC?It won\u2019t be done via stock of ONGC because we would need to pay the Government in India in cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd how much cash will be required for acquisition? Will it be based on current market price or market price at the time of the decision?\n\nIt would be the number of shares multiplied by the price decided between the seller and buyer, which is expected to be the current market price. It is for ONGC and the seller to discuss and reach a price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill it be at a premium to the current market price? I don\u2019t think so, but it would have to be discussed between seller and buyer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne big question which has been asked is about the open offer. Since you will acquire more than 25 percent in HPCL, will it trigger an open offer? \n\nMy understanding of the law is that it cannot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Oil Giant In Making: ONGC To Buy Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there will not be any exit route which will be given to the minority shareholders of HPCL? It\u2019s not required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill you funding the acquisition through internal cash accruals or will you be raising debt? \n\nWe have made some funding plans which will not be shared at this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill it have a debt component to it or will you increase the debt component of ONGC for this acquisition? It can have a debt component which can range from Rs 0-28,000 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you elaborate on what kind of synergy there is for this transaction?\n\nThe integrated companies are much more stable and stronger as compared to the standalone companies. ONGC is an upstream company and has some refining components. Going forward, if and when this transaction is completed, ONGC would become an economy integrated oil and gas company. It will have a component of upstream \u2013 major portion \u2013 and downstream which is refining, petrochemical marketing, everything into it, it would become a stronger company. Especially in today\u2019s environment when crude prices are down and refining margins, petrochemical and marketing margins are up. It would become a stronger company. There would be merit in integration of MRPL and HPCL. Such decisions would need to be taken, if at all, by the boards of those two companies. There would be synergies between HPCL and MRPL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth HPCL and MRPL are listed and any transaction between them would require an arm\u2019s length transaction?\n\nYes, it should be a long-drawn process and we would comply by the laws of the company on the same if at all it happens. Because that call would need to be taken by the board of directors of the two companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you say integration, it eventually means a merger between HPCL and MRPL?Yes but that call would need to be taken by the boards of the two companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at the structure of ONGC now, you as the holding company will have HPCL and MRPL as your subsidiaries, and then you have associates such as Petronet, GAIL and Oil India where you have some stake. Will that bring in some holding company discount to ONGC?I don\u2019t think that holding company discount concept applies - whether the assets are lying in one single entity or in different entities or assets, I don\u2019t think we can talk of any discounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe government will emerge as the only gainer if Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. buys 51 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., said brokerage house CLSA.The country's largest oil explorer will have to shell out close to Rs 28,300 crore to acquire the government's stake in HPCL, as per the closing price of Rs 545 on Monday.

(ONGC), the oil ministry has moved a proposal to the Cabinet to allow pricing freedom for natural gas produced from coal seams.The ministry has proposed to the Cabinet that coal-bed methane (CBM) gas producers be given pricing freedom and allowed to price the fuel at market rates, said people privy to the development.This will help operators quickly put in production the CBM blocks they hold and reverse the trend of investors relinquishing coal-seam blocks due to viability issues of current pricing.Of the 33 CBM bearing blocks awarded so far in four auction rounds and on a nomination basis, gas is being produced from only four.The proposal put to the Cabinet is for allowing CBM operators to sell the gas at market rate determined through an arms-length process, they said, adding that operators are also proposed to be allowed marketing freedom.The move will benefit Reliance which has two blocks in Madhya Pradesh that are in the process of starting production.ONGC and Essar Oil too will benefit from the new policy as it will help them put their acreage into production quickly.The four CBM blocks in production have a combined output of 1.17 million standard cubic metres per day. As many as 18 blocks have either been relinquished or are in the process as operators found that it did not make economic sense to produce gas at the prevailing rates.Most of the natural gas produced in the country is priced at an average of rates prevailing in gas surplus nations like the US, Russia and Canada. The current price comes to $2.5 per million British thermal unit, a rate considered unviable by many operators.Sources said pricing freedom is enshrined in the CBM contracts.These contracts, they added, are based on fixed revenue that the government will get from sale of CBM gas, and higher the rate of gas, the higher the government revenue. Unlike contracts for exploration and production of conventional natural gas, those of CBMs do not provide for cost recovery.According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), India has the 5th largest proven coal reserves in the world and holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. The estimated CBM resources in the country are about 92 trillion cubic feet.The 33 CBM blocks awarded so far hold a total of 62.4 tcf of the estimated CBM resource, of which, so far, 9.9 Tcf has been established as Gas in Place (GIP).The sources said the CBM gas pricing policy proposed to the Cabinet is in line with the recently unveiled regime governing small and marginal oil and natural gas blocks.The government had recently auctioned small and marginal discovered oil and gas fields by promising investors complete pricing, marketing and production freedom under a revenue sharing contract agreement.Pricing freedom would help quickly ramp up CBM gas production to targeted 5.77 mmscmd within a year, they said.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) is likely to acquire the government\u2019s 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL), which in turn will trigger a mandatory open offer for an additional 26 percent stake in the company, according to news reports on PTI and The Economic Times. HPCL\u2019s Chairman MK Surana, told BloombergQuint he would  wait for more information before commenting on the issue. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his 2017 Budget speech said the government plans to integrate state-run oil companies, a move that could help meet the country meet its growing energy demand. HPCL, which is one of the three state-owned oil marketing companies with a refining capacity of 14.8 million metric tonnes per annum could also benefit from ONGC\u2019s massive oil and gas reserves.If the deal does go through, then it will also a long way in helping the government meet its divestment target for financial year 2017-18, while retaining control over the oil marketing company.The government currently owns 68.93 percent in ONGC, and the acquisition will make HPCL a step-down subsidiary of the government.ONGC will have to pay close to Rs 29,061 crore for such a deal, as per the closing price of Rs 561.10 on Monday. It may be a challenge for the upstream company if its cash balance is anything to go by. As of September 30, 2016, the country\u2019s largest energy explorer had cash and cash equivalents of Rs 14,256 crore. It has since handed out two dividend payouts worth Rs 6,738 crore in all and acquired 80 percent participating interest and operatorship of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Ltd.\u2019s (GSPC) block in the Krishna- Godavari basin for Rs 8,100 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only challenge will be for ONGC to pay over Rs 28,000 crore to acquire the stake. But for such kind of expansion plans, ONGC will get credit from the market.\n\nRS Sharma, Former Chairman and Managing Director, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upstream giant will also have to make a mandatory open offer to existing public shareholders, as acquisition of the 51.11 percent government stake will trigger Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) acquisition guidelines. The additional 26 percent in HPCL can cost up to another Rs 15,000 crore.ONGC will have to pay a lot more, if it acquires the government\u2019s stake in any of the other two oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOC) or Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

A holding company structure helps bypass that problem, while creating an integrated oil and gas player and pave the way for HPCL to capitalise on ONGC\u2019s massive asset base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe merger has a lot of practical difficulties; integration through a holding company makes more sense.\n\nRS Sharma, Former CMD, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot every one is convinced about the synergies between the two companies, though. Brokerage house Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. in a report dated February 23, had argued that it made more strategic sense for the government to merge Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) with ONGC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that the government\u2019s aim is primarily to boost the Exploration and Production (E&P) strength of the nation, we see greater probability of ONGC merging with BPCL than with HPCL.\n\nMotilal Oswal Report On February 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBPCL, the report said, has been successful in the E&P segment with discoveries in Brazil and Mozambique. Moreover, HPCL\u2019s aggressive expansion plans could lead to an annual capital outflow of Rs 10,000 crore, over the next 3-4 years, adding to ONGC\u2019s financial burdens, added Motilal Oswal.ONGC supplies crude to oil marketing companies like IOC, BPCL and HPCL.

The nation\u2019s top explorer will spend about 648 billion rupees (about $10 billion) in deepwater projects in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, according to Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC is betting that it can pry more out of the resource-rich area by studying hurdles faced by other companies. Reliance and partner BP have a project in the basin that\u2019s producing only 9 percent of its target. Unearthing deposits from the region, where the depth of water is comparable to those in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are critical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s plans to cut energy imports and help narrow a budget deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe east coast is our future because western offshore fields are in a heavy declining trend,\u201d Sengupta said in an interview in his office in New Delhi. \u201cTo keep India\u2019s gas production alive, the east coast needs to make a tremendous contribution in the next two decades.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest hydrocarbon producer expects the area, including its KG-DWN-98/2 block, will add about 40 million standard cubic meters to daily gas production within five years, according to Sengupta. That\u2019s almost half of India\u2019s net gas production\u00a0of 84 million standard cubic meters a day from April 2016 to February this year. Oil output could rise by 77,000 barrels a day, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC\u2019s block lies next to Reliance\u2019s KG-D6, one of the biggest discoveries of the year when it was found in 2002.

Production also declined because of low flow pressure and natural decreases of deposits in the wells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnological developments over the past few years may help ONGC avoid similar pitfalls. \u201cWe have confidence the technology can mitigate the risks of developing such high-risk areas,\u201d\u00a0Sengupta said, adding that the company has also learnt from the problems that have afflicted others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has done \u201cextensive\u201d appraisals in the area, which has helped it analyze the reservoir\u2019s characteristics, he said.

Reliance and BP, which discovered additional gas pools near the biggest reserves in their block, are awaiting assurances on pricing from the Indian government before they start developing the new deposits, the British company\u2019s chief executive officer, Bob Dudley, told analysts Feb. 28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas Pricing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC is confident its projects are viable at current prices. The cap now for fields that are located in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas is $5.30 per million British thermal units. India sets gas prices every six months using a formula based on U.S., Canadian, U.K. and Russian rates, with the next revision due on April 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe government direction for a different kind of gas pricing is helping us to make these fields viable,\u201d Sengupta said. \u201cONGC is already gearing up for the big work to be done for the import reductions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe board of ONGC is split on the issue of claiming compensation for Rs 11,000 crore worth of natural gas spewing from its KG basin block into adjoining fields of Reliance Industries.The Justice AP Shah Committee on the issue of gas migrating from idling ONGC blocks to RIL\u2019s producing gas fields, last month opined that the compensation for \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d by the Mukesh Ambani-run firm should go to the government and not the state-owned firm. It was of the opinion that the gas belongs to the government and so it alone deserves to be compensated.While ONGC had, in May 2014, not hesitated to file a case against RIL in the Delhi High Court and make the government a party to it, it is now vertically split on the issue. The section of the board which was responsible for the company taking up the issue of RIL producing ONGC\u2019s gas now wants the company to strongly contest the Shah committee recommendation, sources said.The section of the board also believes the company should approach the Delhi High Court since that was an option given by the court, in the event that ONGC was dissatisfied with any part of the dispute resolution, sources added.The other section, however, says it is not wise to fight the government and the company, having proved its point that gas did indeed migrate to RIL fields, should accept the recommendations, they said.The former group also says that the premise on which the Shah committee has based its recommendation was flawed, as according to the committee\u2019s logic, even RIL is not an owner of the gas in its KG-D6 block and it should just be paid a fixed rate of return on investment and not be given pricing and marketing freedom.The oil ministry has asked its technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, to quantify the amount of compensation that RIL has to pay.The Shah Committee stated, \u201cThe Government of India, and not ONGC, is entitled to claim restitution from RIL for the unjust benefit it received and unfairly retained. ONGC has no locus standi to bring a tortuous claim against RIL for trespass/conversion since it does not have any ownership rights or possessory interest in the natural gas.\u201dThe Shah Committee in its report noted and accepted the findings of independent consultant D&M\u2019s report that connectivity between the reservoirs in KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block of RIL and ONGC\u2019s KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML blocks is established.Since April 1, 2009, when RIL began production from KG- D6, to March 31, 2015, 7.009 and 4.116 billion cubic meters of gas had migrated from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG- DWN-98/2 block respectively to KG-D6.Of this 5.968 and 3.015 bcm of gas was produced from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively, through KG-D6.The report further said by January 1, 2017, 7.519 and 4.377 bcm of gas would have migrated from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively to RIL\u2019s KG-D6. Of this, 6.549 and 3.395 BCM of gas would have been produced from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively through KG-D6.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. expects to complete the acquisition of 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. by December end but is unlikely to pay a premium for it.The Department of Divestment and ONGC engaged fund managers and transaction advisers to complete the deal as early as possible, ONGC Chairman DK Sarraf said at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday.To fund the acquisition of HPCL shares, the company may consider selling its stake in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. and GAIL India Ltd. or borrowing money from the market, Sarraf added. ONGC held 13.8 percent stake in IOC and 4.9 percent in GAIL as of June 30, according to BSE data.On whether the buyout could be funded by selling stake in its refining arm Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd., the ONGC chairman said it is up to the boards of the respective companies to make that decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC To Acquire HPCL In Bulk Or Block Deal In November-December\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Open Offer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarraf reiterated that the HPCL stake purchase will not trigger an open offer. Market regulator SEBI\u2019s takeover regulations require that in matters of change in control or the acquisition of 25 percent or more voting right, the acquirer must give public shareholders of the target company the opportunity to exit by tendering their shares in an open offer.The government last month tweaked the terms of HPCL stake sale to ONGC by including phrases that would help avoid the open offer.

It\u2019s invited comments from stakeholders by Jan. 16.The policy is aimed at helping the government meet its target to reduce oil imports by 10 percent by 2022. Imported crude contributes about 80 percent of the consumption in Asia\u2019s second-largest economy, and rising prices widen the current account deficit besides stoking inflation.\u201cThe draft is forward looking. Not only does it demonstrate the government\u2019s intent to boost domestic production but also factors in the learning of the past,\u201d said Deepak Mahurkar, partner and leader (oil and gas), PwC. The production sharing contract prevalent till 2016 didn\u2019t allow unconventional production methods. \u201cAlso, the input cost-based recovery led to disputes and investor disappointment. This policy proposes both: incentives to unconventional production and outcome-based evaluation.\u201dState-run ONGC got a third of its output in the year ended March 2017 by employing such methods that help extract oil not recovered from a reservoir by traditional techniques.Enhanced or improved oil recovery includes methods to boost the output by increasing the pressure in the reservoir, displacing the crude oil, and improving the flow by changing fluid properties like density and viscosity. The best technique depends on temperature, pressure, and depth of the reservoir.ONGC, which has been using such methods, stands to particularly gain from the proposed incentives. Higher exploration costs when oil prices are low threatened its ability to sustain production, it said in its annual report for the year ended March.The draft said there shall be an incentive equivalent to 10 percent of gas wellhead price on the gross production for 10 years. The incentive shall be capped at $0.6 per million British Thermal Units for offshore fields and $0.3 per mmbtu for onshore fields.The policy proposed a government-appointed committee comprising officials from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Directorate General of Hydrocarbons to review and approve the eligibility criteria, pilot and commercial phase, besides the incentives in each case.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nLower-than-expected provision for fuel subsidies in the Budget for 2018-19 raises the possibility of putting the burden back on state-run oil explorers if crude price stays above $55 a barrel.The provision of Rs 21,800 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 20,800 crore in the next financial year as subsidy for under-recoveries on cooking fuels, including the Direct Benefit Transfer on LPG, is lower than the estimates of Rs 25,900 crore and Rs 30,000 crore based on global crude prices of $57.5 a barrel and $60, respectively, in the given period, according to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities. The shortfall raises concern on the possibility of subsidy sharing with the upstream companies in the fourth quarter ended March and the financial year starting April, as was the case till September 2015 when global crude prices averaged above $57 a barrel, the report said.Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. declined more than 10 percent in the last seven straight sessions. Oil India Ltd. stock fell nearly 12 percent in six sessions. The explorers used to share the subsidy burden with the government to keep oil prices low for consumers. That\u2019s because the upstream companies gained from high crude prices. The practice stopped after auto fuels\u2014petrol and diesel\u2014were deregulated and pegged to market rates a little over two years ago. The subsidy continued on kerosene and LPG but was reduced in phases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Union Budget 2018: Petroleum Subsidy Allocation May Fall Short. Here\u2019s Why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the crude around $71 dollars a barrel, the highest in four years, there are concerns that the upstream companies may be asked to compensate oil marketers for their under-recoveries stemming from selling kitchen fuels below the cost of production. Any such decision would impact their earnings.The earnings per share estimates for ONGC and Oil India for the next financial year may decline by 14 percent and Rs 24 percent, respectively, at $60 a barrel of crude if the government does not raise provision of subsidy, Kotak said. It expects risks to the state-run explorers\u2019 earnings to remain an overhang on their stock prices till the results for quarter ending March when clarity on subsidy-sharing may emerge.Calls and text messages to spokespersons of ONGC and Oil India remained unanswered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Expects Delay In Biggest Oil, Gas Project\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.

Explaining the hit Srinivasan said, under GST, the company\u2019s survey costs will rise, as will the upstream oil and gas cost - to Rs 6,500 crore from Rs 4,000 crore currently.The management also outlined its plans to reduce import dependence over the next five years.

This would be ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 percent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company\u2019s board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs 25,000 crore to Rs 35,000 crore.This will be the company\u2019s first-ever debt.\u201cWe will use our cash first and then the liquid assets, and debt will be last,\u201d Shanker had said. \u201cThis order can change because we won't sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs 50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.\u201dShanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company's valuation adviser, EY.Shanker, however, declined to share details.The Rs 473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14 percent higher than Friday\u2019s closing price of HPCL and over 10 percent of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip.Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs 69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL\u2019s valuation at Rs 475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs 500 per share.The stake sale will help the government cross its sell-off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP.The government had set a target of Rs 72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs 54,337.60 crore.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC\u2019s portfolio, making it the third-largest refinery in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries Ltd.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nIn a bonanza to oil producing states like Assam, the government has ordered state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. and Oil India Ltd. to pay royalty to them on the gross price for crude oil and not the net rate they actually realise.As per government mandate, ONGC and Oil India offer discounts on crude oil to make up for a part of the losses refiners suffer on selling cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene at government controlled rates. These discounts also covered diesel till October 2014 when the price of the fuel was deregulated. \nSo in effect, ONGC/OIL would raise a gross bill based on the prevailing international oil price but its actual realisation was less than that after accounting for the subsidy discount. However, producing states felt ONGC and Oil India need to pay royalty on gross billing. The Gujarat High Court in November 2013 ruled in favour of the state government and ONGC was asked to pay about Rs 10,000 crore in past royalty dues.This prompted other oil producing states, particularly Assam, to demand a similar treatment. Till the time Congress ruled Assam, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan maintained that the state government will have to approach the judiciary to get similar relief. \nNow with a BJP government coming to power in the state, his ministry last week issued orders asking ONGC and Oil India to pay royalty at pre-discount rates effective February 1, 2014. \n\u201cIt has been decided that ONGC Ltd and Oil India Ltd will pay royalty to all similarly placed crude oil producing states at pre-discount prices effective February 1, 2014, pending the outcome of the Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)... filed by ONGC Ltd before the Supreme Court (against the Gujarat High Court order),\u201d the ministry order said. \nWith this order, Assam stands to get more than Rs 1,400 crore as additional royalty from ONGC and Oil India. Andhra Pradesh will get about Rs 72 crore extra royalty from ONGC due to this decision.Source: PTI\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s biggest oil explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd., will buy out the government\u2019s 51 percent stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

Since you will acquire more than 25 percent in HPCL, will it trigger an open offer?Sarraf: My understanding of the law is that it cannot.But not all lawyers BloombergQuint spoke to agree with Sarraf\u2019s understanding of the law.Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019s Takeover Regulations require that in matters of change in control or the acquisition of 25 percent or more voting right, the acquirer must give public shareholders of the target company the opportunity to exit by tendering their shares in an open offer. The minimum size of the open offer must be 26 percent.\u201cIt will be argued that directly or indirectly, ONGC and HPCL are government companies and the acquisition will not result in change in management and therefore there is no need for an open offer,\u201d said Mohit Saraf, senior partner at law firm Luthra & Luthra.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nState-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp has won government approval for the acquisition of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp\u2019s entire 80 percent holding in a KG basin gas block for Rs 7,738 crore, the company said.ONGC had in December last year agreed to buy entire 80 percent interest of GSPC along with operatorship rights, in Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in Block KG-OSN-2001/3 in the Bay of Bengal for $995 million (Rs 6,443 crore).The company will also pay part consideration of $200 million (Rs 1,295 crore) to GSPC towards acquisition rights for discoveries other than DDW field in the block.\u201cA farm-in agreement was signed with GSPC on March 10, 2017 with an economic data of March 31, 2017,\u201d ONGC said in notes to its first quarter earning disclosure.During April-June quarter, \u201cGovernment of India has approved the acquisition of entire 80 per cent participating interest of GSPC along with operatorship rights,\u201d it said.ONGC will make payments to GSPC \u201con fulfilment of certain conditions precedent,\u201d it said without elaborating.A company official said the deal is likely to be closed within one month.ONGC will pay $995.26 million for three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another $200 million will be paid for six other discoveries for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan to bring them to production.Jubilant Offshore Drilling Pvt. Ltd. and Geo Global Resources (India) Inc. hold 10 percent stake in the block.Originally, GSPC had offered ONGC its 50 percent stake in the block together with operatorship, but the state-owned firm was not interested. Subsequently, GSPC offered its entire 80 percent stake in the block and ONGC on December 23 last year.GSPC, with a debt of Rs 19,716 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made nine gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three \u2013 KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields \u2013 have been approved for development.But against an approved field development plan cost of $2.75 billion, GSPC has seen a huge cost overrun, incurring $2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had run up an exploration cost of $584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015, to $3.41 billion.As per the requirement of the field development plan, 12 more development wells are yet to be completed, which will further bump up the project cost.The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 million metric standard cubic meter per day (MMSCFD).Commercial production has not commenced as the rate has not yet stabilised. The DGH-approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011.The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries -- KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS -- is under review of GSPC.As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.95 trillion cubic feet (TCF).\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. may miss the June 2019 target of starting production from its Krishna-Godavari basin block due to the implementation of new policies like Goods and Services Tax.GST rollout and local purchase preference rules, including the one that mandates state-owned firms to source domestic iron and steel for infrastructure project are likely to result in a lag in production, said ONGC in a statement on the exchanges.Clarifying on its last week\u2019s filing to stock exchanges, ONGC said the new policies it had cited for a possible delay in production from the basin pertained to local purchase preference policy, steel policy and GST policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Q3 Profit Falls On Higher Depreciation Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the ONGC board had in March 2016 approved a $5.07 billion investment for bringing oil and gas discovered in the KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block in Bay of Bengal to production, new policies were formulated last year.The Union Cabinet in May 2017 approved a policy that will prefer sourcing of domestic iron and steel for infrastructure projects by state-owned companies in a bid to boost Make in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Is Said To Expect Delays In Its Biggest Project\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nGovernment-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. is open to consolidation with the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. after it completes its merger with state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.It makes sense for HPCL and MRPL to \u201ccome into one fold if integration with ONGC has to come true\u201d, said MK Surana, Chairman and Managing Director of HPCL. MRPL is 71 percent owned by ONGC.Both refine crude oil and natural gas. \u201cHPCL holds around 16 percent shares in MRPL and has the right of first refusal. Then logically, the downstream items should be consolidated in HPCL, so there is a reasonable possibility of MRPL getting along with HPCL,\u201d said Surana in a press conference held in Mumbai on September 15. There have not been any formal discussions with the government or between the company boards, he said.ONGC will acquire the government\u2019s 51.11 percent stake in the state-run refiner as part of the plan to create a public sector oil behemoth to compete with global rivals. It will also help the government meet its divestment target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Will Raise Its First Ever Debt To Fund HPCL Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the deal, HPCL and MRPL will become group companies and there may then be another way of acquiring the stake, he said. ONGC\u2019s stake in MRPL is worth $2.5 billion (nearly Rs 17,000 crore) at current market price.Debt-Fuelled Rs 88,000-Crore Capex PlanHPCL is looking to spend Rs 88,000 crore over five years, most of which will be funded by debt. About Rs 25,000 crore will be used for capacity expansion of Vizag and Mumbai refineries and pipeline distribution, another Rs 25,000 crore will cover oil marketing expenses and Rs 10,000 crore will be invested to build a petrochemical complex in Barmer, Rajasthan.The company will invest about Rs 28,000 crore in new refineries in the west coast and Andhra Pradesh, which are also in advanced stage of approvals, said Surana.That takes HPCL\u2019s total capex outlay over the next five years to nearly Rs 1 lakh crore, more than double of Rs 41,697 crore estimated by a Jefferies Equity Research report. And even that would result in a negative free cash flow, bringing down return on capital employed to single digits by the year to March 2021, according to the report authored by Somshankar Sinha, equity analyst at Jefferies.The total investment outlay is nearly 1.4 times HPCL\u2019s current valuation of Rs 73,480 crore. \u201cThe market capitalisation of the company doesn\u2019t decide how much you can invest or not. It is the intrinsic strength of the company which decides that,\u201d said Surana. \u201cDepending on the company\u2019s profitability, its growth plans, creditworthiness and internal generation of resources, we see no problem in borrowing capital as long as we are confident that the debt is serviceable. In fact, we can borrow more if we want to,\u201d he said.HPCL will partially fund the capex and marketing expenses through internally generated Rs 9,000 crore a year and the rest will be borrowed. \u201cOur long-term debt-to-equity ratio is 0.58, which means that we have a leeway,\u201d he said.Other projects, based on joint ventures with state governments and public-sector oil companies, will be funded on the balance sheets of those partnerships and not on HPCL. \u201cTo that extent, HPCL is required to fund only the equity part of it and that we are quite confident of meeting,\u201d said Surana.Care will be taken that the debt to equity ratio of both HPCL and the joint venture projects does not exceed 2:1, he said.The company\u2019s net gearing percentage, which reflects its debt levels related to its equity capital, is at 68 percent. The increased capex, according to Jefferies, will take it to about 100 percent over the next five years. \u201cThis could rise even more if early concept projects also take off or if has to buy MRPL,\u201d the report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe Justice AP Shah Panel submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, a report that found that gas has migrated between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation\u2019s and Reliance Industries Ltd.\u2019s adjacent oil fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.

The move nearly backfired as he dropped a double bogey on the second followed by bogeys on sixth, 12th and 18th. \u201cI played safe and lost all the momentum after the birdie on the opening hole which gave me a five shot cushion but I\u2019m happy that it all ended well for me,\u201dsaid a relieved Amardip, who took home a prize purse of Rs7,50,000 for his victory.The win propelled the Noida golfer to sixth place on the Rolex Rankings for 2017 with earnings of Rs. 14,80,203.\u201cThe Noida Golf Course is my home course and I love coming back here. I have a terrific record here. Winning here is always special. I\u2019m thankful to the club as they\u2019ve always supported me,\u201d added Amardip.Nalini Sharma, Chairperson, Tournament Committee, Noida Golf Course, was delighted with ONGC Masters returning to Noida Golf Course: \u201cOn behalf of the host venue, I would like to thank PGTI and ONGC for a fantastic tournament. This was the third PGTI event this year and our staff did a fantastic job in getting the golf course ready as we had three back-to-back events. We are always there to support PGTI's efforts to promote professional golf in India.\u201dAfter M Dharma had lorded over the greens with an opening round of nine-under 63, Amardip took centre stage with consecutive rounds of 66 to move into the joint halfway lead with Dharma. Amardip produced a sublime 68 in the penultimate round to open up a five stroke lead going into the final day.Kapil Kumar missed a golden opportunity as he interspersed three birdies with equal number of bogeys to finish one stroke behind Amardip while Dharma slid to tied sixth after shooting a final round of three over 75.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Kapil Kumar\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC\u2019s Vikrant Chopra, who finished fourth in PGTI Players Championship at NGC last month and tied third at Jaipur Open 2017, saved his best for the last day. He scorched the course with five birdies on the front nine. However, he missed several birdie opportunities on the back nine as he settled for sole fifth in overall standings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I would stay in contention for the first three days and then falter towards the end, but all that has changed now and I\u2019ve become mentally stronger and more consistent. I have tasted success in team events - winning the LP Cup twice with Navratna Ahmedabad. It was nice to get another top-five finish \u2013 my third in as many weeks. Hopefully, the win is just around the corner,\u201d said Chopra.Coming from a family with Indian Army background, discipline has played a big role in Amardip\u2019s development as a golfer. He was introduced to the game at the age of 15 by his father Col Jagmohan Sinh Malik in US Club, Mumbai. After winning the All India Junior title in 2002, Amardip played in almost every amateur tournament in India and swept to four victories including the Sri Lankan Amateur title before taking the plunge as a professional golfer in 2005.It was baptism by fire as he got disqualified in his first professional event for rule infringement. However, the experience that he gained playing alongside the greats on the pro tour helped him hone his skills and after spending first half of the 2014 season insisting he was close to putting it together, Amardip broke through with his maiden professional title at the PGTI Players Championship at Noida Golf Course in September 2014.Amardip registered four top-10s on the PGTI in 2015 included a joint runner-up finish at the 14th TATA Open and a tied seventh place finish at Bashundhara Bangladesh Open to finish 15th in the Rolex rankings. Amardip had a better 2016 season with five top-10 results on the PGTI including a tied second finish at the TAKE Solutions Classic and a fourth place at the Kolkata Classic.Amardip, who holds a BCom degree, works hard on his game with his coach Romit Bose. Never satisfied with the status quo, he isn't afraid to make major alterations to improve on his winning formula. His daily training schedule includes physical workout, and practice at the golf course. Strict and balanced diet, and regular training stints with physio Sandeep Parihar has also played a vital role in his development as a golfer.For Amardip, \u2018Work hard and party harder\u2019 is his mantra and he likes to follow EPL and all major football leagues and hang out with friends and family. With new found confidence, he is well on his way to fulfil his ambition of winning on the bigger Tours overseas, even as he continues to sharpen his skills on the PGTI.ONGC Masters 2017 Brief Scores:276 - AMARDIP SINH MALIK (66-66-68-76)277 - KAPIL KUMAR (68-67-70-72)278 - R MURTHY (65-70-74-69), OM PRAKASH CHOUHAN (68-69-70-71)279 - VIKRANT CHOPRA (70-69-73-67)280 - HARENDRA GUPTA (69 -71-71-69), M DHARMA(63 -69 -73-75)281 - VEER AHLAWAT (75 -69-71-66), RAHUL BAJAJ (69 -73-69-70)282 - K PRABAGARAN (66 -72-73-71),ABHIJIT SINGH CHADHA (73-72-65-72), MANU GANDAS (71-66-72 -73), ASHOK KUMAR (72-67-68-75)Amardip Up-CloseHome Course: Noida Golf ClubTurned Pro: 2005Role Model: Sadguru Jaggi VasudevDream Four-ball: Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Moe Norman and selfMost memorable moment on a golf course: Winning All India Junior title at KGA in 2002.Best shot ever: Hole-in-one at RCGC during the second round of McLeod Russel Tour Championship 2016Best round: Nine-under par at DDA Open, Qutab Golf CourseFavourite Actor: Bhumi Pednekar and Rajkummar RaoHollywood: Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer LawrenceFavourite Music: Bollywood songsFavourite golf course: India \u2013 Karnataka Golf Association Course, BangaloreAbroad \u2013 Bayonet, California, USAToughest golf course: Delhi Golf Club.Cuisine: Thai and IndianGolf bagDriver: TaylorMadeIrons: TaylorMadeWoods: CallawayWedges: TitleistPutter: Scotty Cameron\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWords - Tilak Malaviya\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe Singapore traded SGX Nifty, an early indicator of Nifty\u2019s performance in India, was little changed at 9,582.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Monday morning briefing.https://t.co/dlkP93uSjv pic.twitter.com/pP8OAKhKnT\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) May 29, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the stocks to watch out for in today\u2019s session:\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nNearly 25 years after ONGC's prime discovered oilfields were privatised, the oil ministry has identified 11 more producing oil and gas fields of the state-run firm for handing over to private firms to raise output.The ministry is approaching the Cabinet to allow private companies take 60 percent stake in producing oil and gas fields of national oil companies, ONGC and OIL, with the view that they would raise production above the baseline estimate.As many as 15 fields - 11 of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and four of Oil India Ltd (OIL) - with a cumulative in-place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified, sources privy to the development said.These include Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar, and Santhal - the big four oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat.All of these fields are in blocks or areas that were given to the national oil companies on nomination basis and the current policy does not allow private firms taking an equity stake in a nomination block. So, a change in policy is required for which the ministry is approaching the cabinet, the sources said.The policy currently allows giving out of participating interest (PI) or a stake to a private company only in the blocks or areas awarded in open auctions under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) since 1999.However, only exploration acreage was auctioned under global bidding in such rounds. All areas prior to that were given to ONGC and OIL on a nomination basis.A baseline based on current oil and gas production from the 15 identified fields would be set and private companies taking 60 percent equity stake would get only the incremental volumes, sources said.The fields would be auctioned and any firm committing the maximum capital investment within 10 years of the contract award and the largest share out of its net revenue to the government would be awarded the field.The 15 fields selected are out of a review of 202 fields operated by the national oil companies. The fields chosen are ones that hold reserves of 20 or more million tonnes of oil equivalent (MT OE) and have crossed the half-way mark on a score (indicative of poor field performance) combining exploration index, current recovery, and production decline rate in the last three years.Of the 202 fields, 141 are either less than 10 years of age or had shown some positive change in the year-on-year production rate.As many as 44 fields of ONGC and OIL have been identified for production enhancement work through Technical Services Model where technical tie-ups would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for 10 years initially.Sources said the ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.It has been tasked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut oil import dependence by 10 percent by 2022 over 77 percent dependence in 2014-15. The dependence has only increased and is now over 80 percent.The privatisation is a repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium-sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in the western offshore was given to now-defunct Enron Corp of the US and Reliance Industries.As many as 28 fields were then awarded.Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm-in 40 percent of stake. The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in a CBI inquiry.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nIndia Inc. has managed to mostly meet street expectations with its second-quarter performance so far, with 14 out of the 23 companies NSE Nifty 50 companies reporting earnings in-line with the forecast.Five companies, including two from the automobile sector, surpassed estimates while four underwhelmed, BloombergQuint analysis showed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big PictureBeat Estimates: 5In Line: 14Miss Estimates: 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose To The Halfway Mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The overseas arm of India\u2019s biggest oil and gas explorer intends to spend more than $3 billion on Iran\u2019s Farzad-B natural gas block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC Videsh Ltd. last month submitted a revised plan to the Iranian government for the block, which the company will be able to develop within five years, Managing Director N.K.

IOC, which has for decades been India's biggest company by turnover, posted a 70 percent jump in net profit to Rs 19,106.40 crore in the financial year ended March 31, 2017.This was more than the Rs 17,900 crore net profit ONGC posted in the 2016-17 fiscal, making IOC the most profitable PSU, according to earning statements of the companies.Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries retained the crown of being India's most profitable company for the third year in a row, posting a net Rs 29,901 crore in financial year 2016-17.Tata Consultancy Services, India's largest software services exporter, with a net profit of Rs 26,357 crore was the second most profitable company in the country.ONGC was long India's most profitable company but lost the crown to private sector Reliance and TCS a couple of years back. It has now been unseated as the most profitable PSU by IOC. In the previous 2015-16 fiscal, IOC had a net profit of Rs 11,242.23 crore as compared to ONGC's Rs 16,140 crore.While IOC Chairman B Ashok attributed the profit growth to higher refining margins, inventory gains and operational efficiencies, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said the company lost Rs 3,000 crore in net profit due to government's natural gas pricing policy that has made the business economically nonviable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso read: India Said to Choose Arrangers for $1 Billion IOC Share Offering\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nAlso Read: More Divestment Through Exchange Traded Funds And A Debt ETF\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nShares of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) rose 3.6 percent on the Bombay Stock Exchange after making their stock market debut at Rs 36.3 apiece on Tuesday.The ETF has a Diversified exposure to various stocks and sectors.

Negotiations between ONGC and the government will follow if the valuation is vastly different from the one the government has arrived at.The share purchase would happen through a bulk or block deal at the prevailing market price, he said, adding that going by the pace of things, the deal could happen sometime in November or December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: HPCL Says Consolidation With ONGC\u2019s Refining Arm Makes Sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth bulk and block deals are done on stock exchanges. A block deal happens when a transaction involves a minimum quantity of 5,00,000 shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore between two parties.Such deal takes place through a separate window at the beginning of trading hours for the duration of 35 minutes i.e. from 9.15 am to 9.50 am in a price range of +1 percent to -1 percent (plus or minus 1 percent) of the ruling market price.A bulk deal is a trade where total quantity of shares bought or sold is more than 0.5 percent of the number of shares of a listed company. Bulk deals happen during the normal trading window provided by the broker.The official said the government's 51.92 crore shares could be sold to ONGC using either the bulk or block deal.This would also help avoid triggering an open offer.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 percent stake in HPCL to ONGC \"along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Will Raise Its First Ever Debt To Fund HPCL Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension it would trigger Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019s (SEBI) takeover code, and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 percent stake from minority shareholders, he said.So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that \u201cHPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013 and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.\u201dThough the government is cashing out on its holding, the amended terms make it clear that it will continue to retain control of HPCL, the official said, adding that since there is no transfer of actual control, there will be no requirement of an open offer.At today's trading price of Rs 428.75, ONGC would have to pay Rs 33,268 crore for buying the government's 51.11 percent stake. Had it been required to make an open offer, it would have had to shell out additional Rs 17,100 crore to buy another 26 percent from the open market.Another official said ONGC will have to borrow about Rs 25,000 crore to fund just the purchase of the government stake.Half of the company's Rs 15,000 crore of cash has already gone into buying Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's stake in a KG basin gas block, and after accounting for capital expenditure requirement for the current year, ONGC will be left with Rs 4,000-5,000 crore.The rest will have to be borrowed, he said.HPCL has 24.8 million tonnes per annum of refining capacity.

Earlier, an offshore jack rig cost $100,000 a day. We hired them at $30,000-35,000 a day,\u201d he said.Oil prices and service costs move in tandem due to demand-supply correlation. Crude has more than doubled from $30 a barrel in January last year to trade as high as $64 this month. The drilling and rig contract prices hit their peak in 2014 when oil traded above $100. Rates plunged over the next two years as a shale boom in the U.S. and falling oil demand triggered an equipment glut.The day rate for hiring a shallow-water jackup rig that ONGC mostly uses declined 55-65 percent over two years, Sanjay Grover, leader (oil and gas), at EY, told BloombergQuint. The fall is steeper at 70-80 percent for deepwater rigs. The service price for drilling has fallen 60-75 percent during the period, he said.ONGC deployed the highest-ever 35 offshore rigs and drilled a record 501 wells in the year to March, according to its annual report. Lower costs pushed up its net realisation from its assets by 6.9 percent over the year-ago period in the September-ended quarter to $51.22 a barrel, its exchange filing said.And it could gain more. \u201cThe way Saudi-Iran tensions are escalating and crude oil prices are moving up.

That\u2019s not the case. It was announced by the finance minister in the Budget and then they consulted us on what we want. We chose HPCL after considering all the pros and cons. We are confident that we\u2019ll be completing the deal before March end.\u201d But he declined to quantify the payout to shareholders, saying that is still under evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplaining why they chose HPCL over BPCL, he said, \u201cWe have around 15 million tonnes refinery in Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemcials, but we have no retail presence, while HCPL has huge retail presence with over 14,400 outlets, but does not have enough refining capacity.

Currently, India is the world's third-largest crude importer and buys up to 80 percent of its supplies from overseas.After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and the Bassein gas fields in 1976, oil and gas behemoth ONGC has not been able to bring in any new major fields into production in the last three decades. India has failed to draw in global oil majors since 1990 despite easing fiscal terms.

India surprised some explorers last year with its 20 percent levy on crude produced locally, moving from a fixed charge. Companies pay more now with crude near $50 a barrel than they did under the old system when it was double the price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGlobally, given the low oil price scenario, governments have provided incentives to stimulate and attract investments,\u201d said Sudhir Mathur, interim chief executive officer at Cairn India. \u201cIn India, the cess rate of 20 percent acts as a disincentive to increase production and commit incremental investments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttracting investments to boost output from local fields is key for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has made energy security a priority and set a target of cutting oil imports by 10 percent in the next five years.

The field currently produces about 80,000 barrels of oil per day (4 million tonnes per annum) and output is envisaged to touch 3,20,000 barrels a day (16 million tonnes).Sources said ONGC Videsh will make a formal bid when National Iranian Oil Company opens a tender for developing the South Azadegan oilfield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther firms prequalified include Japan\u2019s Inpex Corp, China\u2019s CNPC, Eni of Italy, Sinopec of China and Russia\u2019s Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources said ONGC Videsh had last year made its \u2018best\u2019 offer to invest $11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field as well as in building the infrastructure to export the gas but Iran has deterred awarding the rights of the field to the Indian firm owing to differences over pricing of the fuel.With the deal on the verge of collapsing, ONGC Videsh has offered to do just the upstream part of bringing the field to production while leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran, they said, adding that the upstream part is to cost $6.2 billion while another $5 billion will be required to build a liquefied natural gas export facility.Iran believes the upstream investment should not be more than $5.5 billion.Farzad B was discovered by ONGC Videsh in the Farsi block about 10 years ago.

An extension to the planned production cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has failed to take crude prices higher, as the U.S. continues to ramp up shale gas production. Brent crude prices have fallen 20 percent year-to-date, hurting oil explorers' realisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery $5 per barrel fall in oil prices hurts ONGC\u2019s earnings per share by 5-7 percent, said brokerage house Credit Suisse in a report.Tiwari who has retained a 'buy' rating on the stock in his latest report on May 30, believes that the extension in production cuts will help take prices higher in the long run.Dipping Margins In Gas BusinessThe government's new gas pricing rule has led to a drop of more than 50 percent to $2.48 per million British thermal unit. ONGC, which gets a large chunk of its revenue from gas, had earlier said that the government-mandated gas price is significantly lower than the cost of production.At a media conference to announce the company\u2019s last quarterly earnings, Dinesh Saraf, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said natural gas is no more a profitable business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural gas is no more a profitable business, as cost of production is significantly higher than current gas prices.\n\nDinesh Saraf, Chairman and MD, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarraf said the company lost Rs 5,010 crore in revenue in the natural gas business, and about Rs 3,000 crore in profit last year due to lower gas prices.ONGC-HPCL BuyoutAnother overhang on the ONGC stock price is its potential buyout of the government\u2019s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation of India Ltd.The government\u2019s plan to create an energy giant by merging state-owned oil companies will increase ONGC\u2019s debt burden as the company would have to shell out more than Rs 28,000 crore to buy a 51.11 percent stake.ONGC had cash worth Rs 16,648 crore, and a total debt of Rs 55,682 crore, as of March 31, 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transaction will have no impact on operations of HPCL, but ONGC will see a notable increase in debt for purchase of the government\u2019s stake.\n\nCLSA Reaport - Sector Outlook On Oil And Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgan Stanley, the only brokerage tracked by Bloomberg to have a \u2018sell\u2019 rating on the stock cites lack of organic growth in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall consolidated production went up driven by contributions from acquisitions. \n\nMorgan Stanley Note - ONGC Q4 Earnings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brokerage house also mentioned that gas production in India which is expected to grow is less profitable for the company, while the oil business, i.e., the more profitable segment growth is expected to largely remain flat.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nMost brokerage houses have adopted a wait and watch on the ONGC Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Ltd. deal.India\u2019s largest oil explorer will buy government\u2019s 51.1 percent stake in HPCL valued at about Rs 29,900 crore, based on Wednesday\u2019s closing stock price.The move was inline with the government\u2019s plan to create an Indian oil giant through consolidation and mergers, to help it complete with international rivals and help weather crude-price volatility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed More Clarity, Says JPMorganJPMorgan said HPCL shareholders are likely to be disappointed since the government said there will be no open offer, while it expects a relief rally in ONGC.The brokerage house said valuation of the stake still needs to be finalised and a large premium (for the HPCL stake) would be negative for ONGC though clarity would take time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key question is how would the HPCL stake be financed?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan said there are three options for ONGC to finance this potential stake sale.Share swap (unlikely)Market borrowing (could easily be done)Monetization of existing equity investments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatingHPCL: Maintained 'Underweight' rating on the stock with price target at Rs 300ONGC: Maintained 'Neutral' rating with price target at Rs 185\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.'s (ONGC) plan to invest Rs 78,000 crore for development of oil and gas discoveries in Andhra Pradesh may impact the credit rating of the government-run company, Moody's Investors Service said in an analysis report.The large investment will be credit negative for the company, according to the report on ONGC\u2019s latest plans announced on January 28, 2017.

But that does not mean government has sold the company. Government will indirectly hold stake in the company, the official explained.It is a related party transaction which should not trigger takeover code unless the valuations are absurd. If those conditions are satisfied, it will never happen. We have kept in mind the interest of both ONGC and HPCL, the official added.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal, which flows from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget announcement of creating an integrated oil company, will help ONGC spread its risks.From being a mere oil and gas producer, it will also have downstream oil refining and fuel retailing business. \"When upstream business is down, downstream does great and vice versa. So now ONGC will be able to better manage its risks,\" he said. \"Through this vertical integration, what private sector could not achieve, the government has achieved,\" he added.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million ton refinery.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s plan to push its top oil producer to fund a takeover of a state refining company may threaten some near-term investments including a plan to revive a long-delayed development project aimed at cutting the nation\u2019s energy imports, according to company officials with knowledge of its finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil & Natural Gas Corp.\u2019s\u00a0capital expenditure plans, including a $4.5 billion investment in its oil and gas blocks during the year starting in April 1, would be imperiled by the government\u2019s proposal, said the officials, who asked not to be named because the information isn\u2019t public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to push ONGC to purchase the government\u2019s stake in either Hindustan Petroleum Corp., worth $4 billion, or Bharat Petroleum Corp., at $7.7 billion, people with knowledge of the plan said.

The price of gas between October 1 2015 and March 31 2016 was $3.81 per mmBtu and and in the six months prior to that it was $4.66.The next change is due on April 1.The reduction in natural gas prices would mean lower raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) to households and would translate into a reduction in retail prices. It would also mean lower feedstock cost for power generation and manufacturing of fertilisers.But for producers, it means lower revenue. Every dollar dip in gas price results in Rs 4,000 crore hit in revenue for ONGC on an annual basis. The current price reduction would hit its revenue by about Rs 1,000 crore.Alongside the price cut, the government also announced a sharp reduction in cap price based on alternate fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like the deep-sea, which are unviable to develop as per the existing pricing formula.The cap for October 1 2016 till March 31 2017 will be $5.3 per mmBtu, down from $6.61 in the April 1 to September 30 period.The official said ONGC had used this flexibility to sell about 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from a Mumbai offshore field.\"We sold the gas at $5.05 per mmBtu to (state gas utility) GAIL India Ltd. Fortunately, that price remains under the lower cap,\" he said.Indian gas prices are calculated by taking a weighted average price at Henry Hub of the US, National Balancing Point of the UK, rates in Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one quarter.So, the rates for the October 1 2016 to March 31 2017 period were based on average price at the international hubs from July 1 2015 to June 30 2016.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nAsian equities opened mixed on Monday and U.S. Treasuries were steady.

(ONGC) has said the preliminary discussion for its acquisition of India's third-biggest fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. (HPCL) has started and is going on at the ministerial level.\"Talks are going on at the ministerial level. We have not discussed it at the ONGC board. The petroleum ministry wants this to happen because if integration takes place, there will be value creation,\" ONGC Director (onshore) Ved Prakash Mahawar told PTI.Asked about reports on valuation of the deal between ONGC and HPCL, he said, \"These are only guesses. So far, no discussion has taken place at our board meeting.\"Mahawar stressed that merger and acquisitions are strategic decisions of the company and the talks to acquire HPCL are at a preliminary stage at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Pros And Cons Of ONGC Acquiring Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked specifically if any proposal has been prepared to discuss the issue at the ONGC board, he said, \"We have not talked about it yet.\"According to Mahawar, the merger will create value for shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have MRPL (Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd), which does not have retail outlets. If we do a vertical integration of HPCL, then we will take MRPL\u2019s products to retail outlets. We will get the margin of retail outlets as well which we are not getting now.\n\nVed Prakash Mahawar, Director, ONGC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, a source had said India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC may buy all of the government's 51.11 percent stake in HPCL, which will have to be followed by an open offer to acquire additional 26 percent from other shareholders of the retailer.HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.ONGC is already the majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15-million-tonne refinery.The merger is likely to help the world's third-largest oil consumer better compete with global majors in acquiring foreign assets.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nONGC Ltd.'s $2.475 billion purchase of Videocon Group's 10 percent stake in a giant Mozambique gas field has come under the oil ministry's scanner following allegations that the PSU may have overpaid about $200 million, charges that the company vehemently denied.ONGC Videsh Ltd., the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in June 2013 bought 10 percent stake in the Offshore Area 1 from Videocon Group for $2.475 billion. This stake was later divided between OVL and Oil India Ltd. in the ratio of 60:40.The deal has now come under the oil ministry's scanner following allegations that OVL might have overpaid Videocon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment officials said the ministry has over the past few months asked the company to provide several details of the deal including the basis of the valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquest by the ministry was acknowledged by senior company officials, who said details have been provided on multiple occasions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources said Videocon was willing to sell its stake to OVL in 2012, at a small premium to the price Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production paid for acquiring an 8.5 percent stake in the same block from Cove Energy for \u00a31.22 billion ($1.9 billion at exchange rate prevalent at that time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 percent stake, they said, was available to OVL for about $2.3 billion or so but the company a year later paid $2.475 billion to Videocon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn e-mail sent to ONGC Chairman Dinesh K Sarraf, who was Managing Director of OVL at the time of the deal, for comments received a response from the company stating: \u201cThere is no basis to this allegation and ONGC Videsh strongly refutes it.\u201dOVL had followed up the Videocon purchase by buying another 10 percent stake in the same Offshore Area 1 of Mozambique from U.S. energy major Anadarko Corp for $2.64 billion in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, Anadarko in its annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it made a \u2018gain\u2019 of $1.5 billion or over 62 percent of the purchase price, from the sale of 10 percent interest in Offshore Area 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoodlands, Texas-based energy exploration company Anadarko continues to be the operator of the block, with its stake reduced to 26.5 percent from 36.5 percent after the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresently, OVL has 16 percent stake in Offshore Area 1, which holds as much as 75 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOIL has 4 percent and a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd. (BPCL) another 10 percent stake. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 percent stake, ENH (15 percent) and PTTEP (8.5 percent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas from the block is to be converted into Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for transportation by ships to markets like India.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nState-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.

Another $200 million will be paid for six other discoveries for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan to bring them to production.Jubilant Offshore Drilling Private. Ltd. and Geo Global Resources (India) Inc. hold 10 percent stake in the block.Originally, GSPC had offered ONGC its 50 percent stake in the block together with operatorship, but the state-owned firm was not interested. Subsequently, GSPC offered its entire 80 percent stake in the block and ONGC on December 23 last year agreed to acquire the same for $1.2 billion.Two months later, the board approved the acquisition.Besides the payout to GSPC, ONGC will have to pay for the entire development cost of the six discoveries, which may run into at least a couple of billion dollars.GSPC, with a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three\u2014KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields\u2014have been approved for development.But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of $2.75 billion, GSPC has seen a huge cost overrun, incurring $2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had run up an exploration cost of $584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015, to $3.41 billion.As per the requirement of the field development plan (FDP), 12 more development wells are yet to be completed, which will further bump up the project cost.The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd.Commercial production has not commenced as the rate has not yet stabilised. The DGH-approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011.The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries\u2014KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS\u2014is under review of GSPC.As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.95 trillion cubic feet (tcf).\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nONGC to buy government\u2019s stake in HPCLJust Dial shareholders approve buybackGodrej Agrovet files DRHP for IPOIDBI Bank to raise funds via QIPKEI Industries to set up manufacturing unit in Rajasthan\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nAsian stocks gained as trade war concerns took a backseat to economic optimism following a U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the American economy continued to strengthen without the prior month\u2019s rapid wage gains that stoked inflation fears.The Singapore-traded SGX Nifty, an early indicator of NSE Nifty 50 Index\u2019s performance in India, rose 1.2 percent to 10,336 as of 6:55 a.m.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreditors\u2019 panel yet to take a call on Binani Cement\u2019s resolution plan, says UltraTech Cement. https://t.co/xTZyF1AKWq pic.twitter.com/fAUjYIGPfS\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) March 11, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere Are The Stocks To Watch Out For On Monday's TradeCCI approved the acquisition of Reliance Communication\u2019s towers, optic fibre cable, right to use spectrum and media convergence nodes by Reliance Jio.JSW Group unit to buy 50 percent stake in GMR owned IPL cricket team - Delhi Daredevils.Bhushan Steel clarified that Chairman BB Singhal appeared before SFIO on March 8.Wilmar Sugar to make an open offer to acquire additional 49.8 crore shares, representing 26 percent equity in Shree Renuka Sugars at a price of Rs 16.29 each (premium of 4.75 percent from Friday's closing price).Dolphin Offshore Enterprises bagged order worth Rs 6.75 crore from RAL, Malaysia.Power Grid won contract to establish transmission system for \u201cNew WR-NR 765 kV Inter-Regional Corridor\u201d.RBI imposed penalty of Rs 5 crore on Airtel Payments Bank.Bharat Wire Ropes seeks to raise Rs 50 crore via equity or debt.Tata Motors\u2019 group global wholesales up 18 percent YoY to 1.21 lakh units in February.Bharti Airtel received NCLT approval for merger of Telenor with self.ARSS Infrastructure bagged work order worth Rs 15.44 crore.Amber Enterprises to acquire 70 percent in Ever Electronics.MOIL approved the setting up ferro alloy plants at Balaghat and Gumgaon for Rs 418.8 crore.Oriental Bank Of Commerce to increase some marginal cost loan rates by 5-15 basis points from March 12.Peninsula Land to acquire additional 6.4 percent stake in Hem Infra for Rs 13.79 crore.IFC and IFC FIG to sell 1.2 percent of total 5 percent stake in Bandhan Bank through the proposed IPO of the lender that opens from March 15, reported PTI.Aarti Drugs said that its unit in Tarapur MIDC got affected by explosion.

The oil explorer, however, doesn\u2019t have the cash to fully fund the deal. It had Rs 16,648 crore cash as of March, leaving it short of more than Rs 12,000 crore at current valuations.Which means, it will have to borrow more, adding to its Rs 55,682-crore debt at the end of March. Or, it could sell assets.The upstream oil major might look to sell its 13.8 percent stake in state-run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. valued at more than Rs 25,000 crore, CLSA had in a report earlier. The sale will impact IOC\u2019s share price, it said. However, it will limit any incremental value leakage and minimise net negative value impact on ONGC, the brokerage said.Refining CapacityThe buyout will add HPCL\u2019s 15.8 million tonnes of annual crude refining capacity to ONGC\u2019s portfolio. The explorer is a majority owner of Mangalore Refineries & Petrochemicals Ltd., which operates a 15 million-tonne refinery in southern India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the completion of the buyout by ONGC, HPCL will be merged with MRPL, ONGC Chairman DK Sarraf told BloombergQuint over the phone. \"There would be synergies between HPCL and MRPL in consolidation of the two,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nState-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) has said that producing natural gas is no longer a profitable business for the company as the government-mandated gas price is significantly below the cost of production.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the U.S., Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country. Prices have halved to $2.48 per million British thermal unit since the formula was implemented. ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said the company lost Rs 5,010 crore in revenue on natural gas business, and about Rs 3,000 crore in profit last year due to lower gas prices.\"Natural gas is no more a profitable business because cost of production is very significantly higher than current gas prices,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ONGC Misses Estimates On Higher Employee Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor any company it does not make economic or commercial sense to invest in new fields or in augmenting production from existing ones through fresh investment if the price it will get is below the cost of production.Sarraf said the price paid to domestic producers is less than half of the rate paid for import of gas (LNG).India currently imports half of its natural gas needs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen on cutting down import bill by raising indigenous production and 'Make in India'. ONGC, he said, has sought a review of the natural gas pricing formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have no reason to disbelieve that gas prices will not be raised.Dinesh K Sarraf, ONGC Chairman And Managing Director \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at $4.2 per mmBtu for the business to make economic sense.\"Keeping in view of cost of production of gas, cost of alternate fuels and other market dynamics, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is requested to review the existing domestic gas price formula and provide a floor price at least to the level of earlier APM (regulated) price ($4.20 per mmBtu)/ non-APM price ($4.20 to $5.25 per mmBtu) fixed in June 2010,\" ONGC said in a recent communique.The new formula provides for revising rates every six months- on April 1 and October 1, based on one-year average gas price in the surplus nations with a lag of one quarter.When the formula was implemented, rates went up from $4.2 to $5.05 per mmBtu but fell to $4.66 per mmBtu in April 2015 and to $3.82 in October that year. It further dipped to $3.06 per mmBtu in April 2016 and to $2.50 per mmBtu in October 2016.

But now that it's\u00a0pulled the trigger, State Bank of India and other domestic creditors won't be terribly unhappy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian wireless company owes one fifth of its $7 billion\u00a0debt to CDB, which organized a syndicated loan for billionaire Anil Ambani's firm in 2011. While operational creditors such as\u00a0Ericsson India Private Ltd. and Tech Mahindra Ltd. have previously approached India's National Company Law Tribunal to start insolvency proceedings against RCom, this new petition by a hefty financial creditor comes as the biggest challenge for Ambani's desire to hold on to at least a minority stake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fate of that plan hangs on a privately negotiated offer that involves a pledge to sell wireless spectrum, towers, fiber-optic networks and related assets for $2.6 billion, as well as real estate for $1.55 billion, and move $930 million of obligations to a shrunk, new RCom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo that $5 billion resolution, add a proposed $1 billion debt-to-equity swap in favor of creditors, plus whatever liquid assets the company might still have (RCom had roughly $215 million of cash and equivalents in March), and the insolvency looks more or less resolved.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn paper, Ambani's is a\u00a0zero loan write-off plan. But then, RCom's previous attempts to deleverage by merging its cellular business with another operator and selling a stake in the towers have come to nothing. It has already shuttered its 2G and 3G consumer businesses, and\u00a0skipped a coupon on a $300 million bond. At 36 cents on the dollar, the price of the defaulted security suggests skepticism about the recovery rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo by bringing the sword of bankruptcy closer to RCom's neck,  CDB gets to negotiate a sweeter deal with Ambani, preferably one in which there's no loan-to-equity conversion. That's something Indian banks won't mind. After all, which creditor would buy a stock at 24.71 rupees (about 38 cents, the price agreed on in June) when the shares currently trade at 13.35 rupees?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCom says it's surprised by CDB's\u00a0\"untimely and premature action.\"\u00a0The real shock, though, is that RCom is surprised: REDD Intelligence said on Nov. 6. that CDB was scouting for advisory firms to manage the firm in bankruptcy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this is a just a game. By themselves, India's capital-starved creditors can't bring enough pressure to bear on RCom. The company knows how reluctant they are to make 50 percent provisions against secured soured loans -- and 100 percent against unsecured duds, as required by the regulator -- should they refuse to accept Ambani's restructuring plan by a December deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDB, however, is a different beast. It has so much more to lose in Venezuela -- and perhaps also in Pakistan, as my colleagues Nisha Gopalan and Shuli Ren have argued -- that its RCom exposure is chump change in comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of CDB's RCom exposure relative to VenezuelaChump change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat makes\u00a0the Chinese bank\u00a0a credible threat, and a pal of Indian lenders. But only up to a point. If CDB pushes too hard, and RCom does slip into bankruptcy, then Indian banks' profits for this quarter will be toast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chinese friend could turn into a frenemy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Gadfly columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

On Wednesday, the stock fell to below Rs 10 per share, hitting a lifetime low. Year to date, shares of the Anil Ambani led telecommunication firm have fallen 37 percent.The most recent decline in the company\u2019s share price followed a confirmation that it had defaulted on its dollar debt. This was not unexpected since the company has stated that as per a \u2018standstill\u2019 agreement with domestic lenders, it would not pay dues on any debt till December 2018. Though whether the standstill applies to the foreign bondholders is unclear.But as the company\u2019s share price continues to fall, that very standstill agreement may be at risk. Here\u2019s why.In June 2017, domestic lenders approved Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) in the case of RCom. As per details of the agreement released by the company, Rs 7,100 crore in debt was to be converted into 51 percent equity in the company. The company\u2019s total debt stands at about Rs 45,000 crore.While this plan was agreed upon in June, lenders decided to hold off on the actual conversion until December 2017. This is in accordance with Reserve Bank of India\u2019s rules, which allow lenders 180 days to complete the actual conversion. In many other cases, the conversion has not actually happened even though it was approved for a variety of reasons. In the case of RCom, in June the hope among lenders was that deals that were in the works (such as a merger with Aircel Ltd. and a sale of the tower business to Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.) would fructify within the six month period. If they had, banks would have secured a relatively easy exit.But that hasn\u2019t happened.The deals have failed to close and the stock has fallen. Notably, it has fallen well below the conversion price of Rs 24.71 per share, which the company arrived at using RBI\u2019s formula and June 2 as the reference date. According to the RBI formula, conversion of debt to equity has to be at a price which is at least the average of the closing prices of the 10 trading days preceding the reference date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenders, as many as 27 domestic banks, financial institutions and foreign banks, now face two options. Convert at Rs 24.71 per share and take a material mark-to-market loss immediately upon conversion. Or allow the SDR agreement to lapse, which, in all probability, will result in the account becoming a non performing asset.Two lenders, who spoke to BloombergQuint on condition of anonymity, said that they are monitoring developments and will \u2018co-ordinate\u2019 their action against the company. On November 4, BloombergQuint reported that banks were not keen on approving the SDR in the current form as the conversion price is too high.But the alternative is not an attractive one either.If the SDR fails, lenders will have to provide against the Rs 45,000 crore in debt. This would impact bad loan ratios and profitability across most banks.Either way, they will have to take a hit,\"If the debt is much higher than the underlying value of the company, the bankers will have to take a hit. That is always the case. Now whether you take it as a mark to market hit or a loan loss, that is something that the bankers involved need to decide on. Typically, delays lead to larger losses,\" said RK Bansal, former executive director at IDBI Bank. He was not commenting specifically on the RCom case since he is not involved in it.Insolvency PetitionsMeanwhile, the company is battling its operational creditors as well.On Wednesday, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal issued a notice to RCom on an insolvency plea filed by Manipal Technologies Ltd.. Earlier, the National Company Law Tribunal had rejected the plea by Manipal Technologies, which claims that the company owes it Rs 2.7 crore. The matter will be heard on December 4.A separate insolvency petition filed by Ericsson India, the telecom equipment vendor to RCom, is scheduled to be heard on November 23, according to the NCLT website. Ericsson claims the telco owes it Rs 1,156 crore.If the insolvency petitions against the company are admitted, the implications for the SDR process are also unclear.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Bondholders of Reliance Communications Ltd., the embattled Indian mobile phone operator controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, have hired advisers after the company defaulted on its dollar-denominated notes last month.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain investors holding a significant percentage of the securities have formed a committee, which has appointed PJT Partners Inc. as its financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis LLP as its legal adviser, according to a document seen by Bloomberg News.

These offerings could potentially be \u201cbetter valued\u201d if Jio were to be separately listed, it added.Measuring the telecom operators\u2019 performance based on key parameters such as subscriber addition, steady increase in tariffs and a positive operational profit in the first quarter of commercial operations, JPMorgan expects Jio to report a profit in the third quarter of the current financial year \u201cahead of schedule\u201d.In the September-ended quarter, Jio\u2019s average revenue per user stood at Rs 156.4. That compares with Rs 154 blended ARPU reported by Bharti Airtel Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the consolidated level, RIL\u2019s net debt has increased materially as spending in core projects coincided with capital expenditure for Reliance Jio. While the core projects should start delivering strong operating profit, a Jio listing should \u201cpotentially upstream some cash to parent RIL\u201d, where it has invested over Rs 2 lakh crore, the brokerage said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther HighlightsJio is tracking ahead of forecasts in terms of subscriber additions, EBITDA margins and profit breakeven.It has delivered on all targets so far; next is diversifying the revenue base.Jio is expected to be the key driver for RIL stock price in CY18 as well.The company\u2019s EBITDA will increase from Rs 24,000 crore in financial year 2019-20 to Rs 36,700 in financial year 2021-22.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe initial public offer of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management was subscribed 81.22 times so far on the last day of bidding today.The IPO to raise an estimated Rs 1,542.42 crore received bids for 347 crore shares against the total issue size of 4.28 crore shares (excluding anchor portion), according to NSE data till 4:15 pm.Till yesterday, the IPO was oversubscribed 7.45 times.

An appreciation of 15 percent in the stock in compound annual growth rate terms would require telecom sector value to increase to $75 billion in three years, which seems unlikely due to elevated levels of capital expenditure, the brokerage said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, telecom ramp-up might be irregular as average realisations per subscriber may remain muted due to customer pushback on tariffs and increased competition, Jefferies noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong key negatives, the company\u2019s return ratios stay modest even as earnings per share rise. Net debt is likely to remain floated, free cash flow might lag expectations and earnings may falter too, the brokerage added.The operating profit is expected to double to $20 billion over the next four-five years as new projects begin fructifying, but much of that appears to be priced in the company value, said the brokerage.

The price cut indicates pricing discipline may still be uncertain and highly dependent on consumer behaviour despite consolidation in the industry paving the way for long-term structural improvements. Two large telecoms registered an ARPU decline of 25 percent year-on-year each for the second quarter of the financial year. Jio reported an ARPU of Rs 156 for the September-ended quarter compared with Rs 84 recorded for the industry for the period, as Jio\u2019s entire customer base comprises of broadband data subscribers.Meanwhile, broadband data subscribers constitute only 20 percent of the customer bases of other large telecom firms. Non-broadband subscribers are typically low ARPU-generating customers.According to India Ratings, top telecom operators would focus more on increasing their subscriber market share than revenue market share during 2018 and the dual-sim phenomenon would continue for longer-than-expected, given low customer loyalty and high price sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, the industry pricing trend is moving towards competitive pricing on long validity plans (70-90 days) to increase customer stickiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Offers The Cheapest Tariffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough current competitive tariffs do not seem sustainable, the short-term outlook for the ARPU remains subdued, thus indicating another tough year for the telecom sector.Mounting pricing pressure, debt burden and capital outlay needs led to the exit of small telecom firms from the market. Large operators have prepared themselves for the continued challenging environment via asset monetisation, which emerged as a key credit theme in 2017, besides industry consolidation.India Ratings previously expected a recovery in ARPU in mid-to-late financial year 2018-19 in view of a likely stabilisation of industry tariffs at a higher level that would have led to user SIM consolidation. Jio increased pricing by 40 percent in October 2017. Thereafter, it reduced the validity on the Rs 309 plan to 49 days from 84 days. However, it has announced cashback offers to ensure customer stickiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio To Buy RCom\u2019s Spectrum And Towers\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nDirect-to-home television provider Reliance Big TV announced that it will offer free access to up to 500 free-to-air channels for five years, and pay channels for one year.The company will also provide a free-of-cost high definition set top box, Reliance Big TV said in a statement.

Disallowing costs will result in government's profit share rising.The government has claimed an additional $175 million as its profit share after the cost disallowance, the official said.Gas production from Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas field in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block was supposed to be 80 million standard cubic meters (mmscmd) per day but actual production was only 35.33 mmscmd in 2011-12, 20.88 mmscmd in 2012-13 and 9.77 mmscmd in 2013-14. The output has continued to drop in the subsequent years and is now below 4 mmscmd.Emails sent to RIL and BP remained unanswered. The two companies have challenged the cost disallowance of the past years and have initiated an international arbitration seeking dropping of the same on grounds that the PSC does not provide for any such punishment.The government had for 2010-11 disallowed $457 million of cost, $548 million for 2011-12, $792 million for 2012-13, $579 million for 2013-14 and $380 million for 2014-15.Now an additional $264 million has been disallowed for output lagging behind target in 2015-16. The output was behind target in 2016-17 as well and the cost disallowance will be calculated only next year, the official said.RIL had previously stated that \u201cevery year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the contractor group does not agree), the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with figures of the previous years. It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as Government of India share.\u201dOf the additional profit petroleum claimed, the government has already collected gross $81.7 million in the gas pool account by taking away any gas price higher than $4.2 per million British thermal unit during November 2014 to March 2016 period.From April 2016 to date, the gas price has been less than $4.2 and no deposits were made to the gas pool account. Contractor group refers to RIL and its partners BP and Niko. RIL holds 60 percent interest in block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 in Bay of Bengal. BP has 30 percent and Niko the remaining 10 percent.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nReliance Communications Ltd.\u2019s Chairman Anil Ambani said the telecom operator has been in talks with its lenders and has their support even as they await stake sale in tower arm and merger with Aircel to go through to pare debt.The operator is considering several options to handle its debt and expects to find a solution in the course of this financial year. \u201cThere is no magic wand for us; we don't want it nor do we deserve it,\u201d Ambani said. Reliance Communications has a gross debt of 45,733 crore, and lenders have given it till December to repay.On September 11, Ericsson filed an insolvency plea at the National Company Law Tribunal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code to recover Rs 1,150 crore from Reliance Communications for services and equipment it had earlier supplied.

Banks are not willing to lend to the financially stressed telecom operators, hindering the growth of the capital-intensive sector, he said.Reiterating that the sector\u2019s collective debt stood at Rs 9 lakh crore, Ambani said all stakeholders including the government and lenders need to find a solution to the problem. He cautioned against what he called Indian telecom sector's shift from competition to oligopoly, duopoly or even monopoly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wireless sector which had 10 players earlier is now under a threat of becoming a potential monopoly. So we have to rethink strategies for the sector.Anil Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Reliance Communications, in particular, the threat is primarily to the wireless segment while the other businesses are relatively better off, he said.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nMukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. stands to gain from another regulatory change that will also keep its larger rivals in check.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, through its new tariff order, revised the definition of \u201csignificant market power\u201d that prevents a wireless carrier from misusing its dominant position. Service providers holding a share of at least 30 percent of total activity in a relevant market qualify for it. The changed rules mean Reliance Jio, despite having the highest share in the data market, stays out of its ambit.While the new definition of significant market power is somewhat in line with the old view, it doesn\u2019t reflect the current reality, Mahesh Uppal, director at consultancy ComFirst (India), told BloombergQuint. \u201cThe definition fails to reflect that Reliance Jio is not a stereotype young small player but a formidable corporation that is making a huge dent and bidding for power in telecom sector.\u201dThe new norms mean India\u2019s youngest telecom operator can continue to undercut rivals. That\u2019s when it has already triggered consolidation in the world\u2019s second-biggest telecom market by unleashing a tariff war, first with free services and then cut-rate plans, hurting profits of older rivals. The regulator\u2019s decision to slash interconnect charges for cross-network calls by more than half came as another boost. Upstart Reliance Jio is the net payer of such fees while older rivals with deeper networks were the net earners. The new tariff order will help it further dent its rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ChangesOf the four parameters to identify significant market power, TRAI in its new order retained subscriber base and gross revenue, but dropped capacity and traffic share. Reliance Jio has the highest monthly data consumption per user or traffic share. So, the exclusion benefits the company.Restrictions remain on Bharti Airtel Ltd., India\u2019s largest telecom operator, and the combine of Idea Cellular Ltd. and Vodafone India Ltd. Bharti Airtel has more than 30 percent customer market share in nine circles, while Vodafone-Idea breach the 30 percent mark in more than 10 circles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Ideal Cellular were yet to respond to BloombergQuint\u2019s emailed queries.The changes made in the definition of significant market power benefits only the new player in the industry, said Rajan Mathews, director general of industry lobby Cellular Operators Association of India. \u201cOther major operators still remain under the ambit.\u201dTRAI said that only an incumbent operator enjoying the significant marker power can distort the market. \u201cWe beg to differ,\u201d said brokerage Kotak Securities in a note. \u201cThat fails to capture the current reality across many industries.\u201dHow It WorksFor determining predatory pricing, the regulator will consider average variable cost as the benchmark. Any tariff charged below the cost would be considered the misuse of the dominant position. The onus of providing the business rationale of pricing below the average variable cost rests on the operator.Which means, incumbents like Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea may not be allowed to price below the average variable cost, even for promotional offers, to increase market share.The only solace is that the larger operators can match competitive pricing of rivals to protect market share. Still, that restricts their ability to undercut Reliance Jio to challenge it with lower pricing.Chances of the carriers pricing below Reliance Jio are, however, slim as the Ambani-owned operator has promised customers to offer 20 percent more value compared with its rivals.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nInfrastructure lender IFCI Ltd. has initiated insolvency proceedings against Anil Ambani-led Reliance Naval & Engineering at the National Company Law Tribunal in Ahmedabad.The Delhi-based development financial institution had lent approximately Rs 60 crore to Reliance Marine & Offshore Ltd., a subsidiary of Reliance Naval.

While that\u2019s ahead of projections, it would still leave revenue little changed from the same period a year earlier, underscoring how difficult it is for the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker to expand total sales while its largest business stagnates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to spread Intel\u2019s bets more widely by adding new products that will make the company\u2019s chips essential in areas such as self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. He\u2019s managing that transition while still relying on a PC market that has shrunk every year since 2011, and a server-chip business that\u2019s dependent on the capital spending plans of a handful of companies to generate a large portion of its profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are going through a transformation,\u201d said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets in San Francisco. She recommends buying the stock. \u201cThey\u2019re handling it and realigning the organization in the face of a very challenging environment when their core business is on a secular decline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel shares rose about 2 percent in extended trading following the announcement, after closing at $41.35 in regular New York trading. The stock has lagged behind peers this year with a 14 percent gain, less than half of the 36 percent advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross margin will be about 63 percent in the fourth quarter. That prediction and the sales forecast, which\u00a0includes a range of plus or minus $500 million, compare with average analysts\u2019 estimates for $16.1 billion in revenue and margin of 62.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird-quarter results got a lift from robust growth in Intel\u2019s memory-chip and internet of things units. Net income rose to $4.5 billion, or 94 cents a share, from $3.4 billion, or 69 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Sales climbed 2 percent to $16.1 billion. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.01 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 80 cents in profit on revenue of $15.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s management said on a conference call they will try to tighten spending and reduce annual operating expenses to 30 percent of revenue by 2020, helping extend gains by the stock. The company reduced costs in the recent quarter to below that level through a change in the way it accounts for marketing subsidies paid to PC makers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, market researchers said the PC market lost ground again in the third quarter, with shipments falling 3.6 percent. The latest results were hampered because the back-to-school season didn\u2019t provide its traditional boost in demand, Gartner Inc. said. Industry shipments peaked in 2011 at 363.8 million. In 2016 they were more than 100 million units short of that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen declining growth but relatively stable. Our unit volume in the quarter was a little bit better than that, \u201d said Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan. \u201cConsumers are continuing to pay up for high-performance products. Our average selling prices are up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s PC chip unit had sales of $8.9 billion, flat from a year earlier. In PCs, Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Swan said the market\u2019s competitive dynamics haven\u2019t changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $4.9 billion, an increase of 7 percent. Krzanich has said that business can achieve growth of more than 10 percent over the long term. Its performance is increasingly dependent on orders from cloud companies such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s web services unit. Their data centers are expanding at the expense of in-house server farms at corporations that are outsourcing their computing needs to providers of services over the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin that division, sales from data-center operators were up 24 percent in the quarter, helping making up for a 6 percent decline in revenue from corporations, the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of Intel\u2019s newer businesses, memory and internet of things, registered sales growth of 37 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Still, the impact of that growth was limited because those divisions are each only about a 10th the size of the PC-chip business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nReliance Capital in focus as subsidiary Reliance Home lists todayKNR Construction JV bags order worth Rs 884.47 crore from Telangana governmentA2Z Infra makes one-time settlement with banks as part of the corporate debt restructuring agreementBharti Airtel gets shareholders nod for merger of Telenor with companyInterGlobe Aviation approves allotment of 3.35 crore shares pursuant to QIP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Singapore-traded SGX Nifty, an early indicator of Nifty 50 Index\u2019s performance in India fell 0.55 percent to 10,085 as of 7:30 am\n\n\n\n\n\nYour guide to today's trade.https://t.co/piDdhTARx8\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) September 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the stocks to watch out for in today\u2019s session:\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s richest man is weighing an initial public offering of mobile operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said, after a $31 billion investment spree that roiled the country\u2019s wireless market.Reliance Industries Ltd., the conglomerate backed by tycoon Mukesh Ambani, is holding internal discussions about preparing to list Jio as soon as late 2018 or early 2019, according to the people. Jio, which hasn\u2019t made a profit since its official launch last year, is targeting to improve its financial performance before any share sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.A Jio listing would cap a triumphant return to the Indian wireless market for Ambani, more than a decade after a family feud that led him to cede control of a previous telecom venture to his younger brother. Jio, which is wholly owned by Reliance Industries, launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world\u2019s most crowded mobile markets.Bharti Airtel Ltd. this year agreed to absorb Tata Group\u2019s mobile-phone business, while Vodafone Group Plc and Idea Cellular Ltd. announced they would merge their local operations to create the nation\u2019s largest wireless operator.

A representative for Reliance Industries declined to comment.Jio reported a net loss of 2.71 billion rupees ($42 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, though the business made a profit before interest and taxes over the period.

Shares of Reliance Industries have jumped 70 percent this year, giving the company a market value of about $93 billion.India\u2019s benchmark index is trading near an all-time high, which has helped fuel a record IPO haul in the country.

These charts show some of the factors behind the stumble -- starting with one showing a drop in the firm\u2019s earnings before depreciation, interest and tax over interest expenses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debt strains at Reliance Communications come amid a broader trend of increased borrowing in India\u2019s telecom industry, as this chart shows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications has fallen further in the stock and bond market after missing interest payments on debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nA growing user base and charges paid for spectrum and cross-network calls pushed up regulatory expenses for Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.The Mukesh Ambani-led telecom operator\u2019s gross revenue stood at Rs 1,150 crore in the quarter ended June, which includes both consumer spend and revenue from interconnect usage charges. Adjusted gross revenue was a negative Rs 1,000 crore. Which means, Reliance Jio spent Rs 2,150 crore on access and other charges, 43 percent higher than the previous three months, quarterly data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show.Reliance Jio\u2019s total user base increased to 12.3 crore as of June end from 10.8 crore on March 31. The company offers some of the lowest data tariffs and highest discounts since it started charging subscribers from April after six months of free services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Why Reliance Jio Wants Interconnect Charges To Be Zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore users mean Reliance Jio will have to pay higher interconnection call charges related to cross-operator calls. For example, Reliance Jio pays a fee for every call its subscriber makes to a Bharti Airtel Ltd. user, and vice versa.Which means, older operators with more subscribers and bigger networks tend to receive more calls and thus make money from the charge. A smaller rival like Reliance Jio that offers free voice calls becomes a net payer. Reliance Jio has been pitching for no or low interconnection call charges.The telecom operator is yet to recognise its revenue, an accounting practice that will offer more insight into its profitability.Overall, the telecom industry\u2019s adjusted gross revenue fell 4.7 percent to Rs 28,300 crore in the June-ended quarter over the previous three months, burdened by higher access charges paid between operators, the TRAI data showed. That indicates consumer spend on telecom has declined, thanks to the ongoing discount war.Vodafone India\u2019s adjusted gross revenue rose fell by 2.3 percent sequentially to Rs 7100 crore. Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular saw a decline of 4.6 percent and 3.8 percent to Rs 9,900 crore and Rs 6,200 crore, respectively.The adjusted gross revenue of the industry is likely to rise from the quarter ended December onward on a low base and improvement in Reliance Jio\u2019s revenue, a note by brokerage ICICI Securities said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: TRAI To Soon Complete Review Of Interconnection Usage Charges\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nLupin\u2019s Aurangabad facility gets EIRMcNally Bharat wins orderBiocon to sell biosimilars business subsidiarySubex board approves restructuring schemeCentral Bank of India revises savings rates\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nReliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the telecommunications business of Mukesh Ambani - led Reliance Industries Ltd. pulled a surprise by turning in an operating profit within just three months of its commercial launch.Jio reported higher than expected revenue based on subscription recharges and lower than expected operational cost in its July - September 2017 quarterly earnings.Net revenue: Rs 6,147 croreEBIT: Rs 260 croreNet loss: Rs 271 croreReliance Jio started operations in December 2016 but pegged its commercial launch to \u201cquality of service\u201d conditions and has hence reported the July to September 2017 period as its first commercial quarter.The business beat analysts\u2019 expectations of continuing losses on the basis of 3 important factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Higher Than Anticipated Revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio reported an average revenue per user of Rs 156, so far the highest amongst its competitors.The key revenue contributors wereRecharges done in the July - September 2017 period.Prime membership revenue proportionate to the quarter.Subscription recharges done in April, accounted for in July.This resulted in Jio reporting revenue from the earlier quarter in Q2. Because subscribers who paid for promotional plans \u2018Summer Surprise\u2019 and \u2018Dhan Dhana Dhan\u2019 were provided free services for the first three months starting April, effectively making the fourth month, i.e., July chargeable.This was emphasised in an earlier statement by the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery JIO PRIME member \u2013 when they make their first paid recharge prior to 15th April using Jio\u2019s Rs 303 plan (or any higher value plan) \u2013 will get services for the INITIAL 3\nMONTHS  on a complimentary basis. Your paid tariff plan will be applied only in July, after the expiry of the complimentary service.Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, Reliance Industries (Statement on March 31, 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrokerages have acknowledged the company booked revenue from the earlier quarter.Reliance Jio \u201cdid benefit from some revenue booking of Q1 which helped push up the ARPU,\u201d said a note by JP Morgan\u2019s Asia Pacific Equity Research team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur calculations suggest Jio\u2019s realisable ARPU for Q2FY18 must have been around Rs 121/month, instead of the reported amount of Rs 156/month, including Rs 8 for IUC, Rs 107 pertaining to recharges and\u00a0 Rs 7 for prime planKotak Securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of active subscribers at 13.1 crore (131 million) versus 13.86 crore (138.6 million) total subscribers also surprised the street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a bigger\nnumber than most estimates which were based on reported VLR (active subscribers) data\nwhich suggested 100 million. Jio explained that as many of its subs are pure data\nusers who may use it only few days in a week they do not feature in\nVLR methodology but are still paying for services.\u00a0CLSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Capitalisation Of Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CLSA note said employee and other expenses came in lower than anticipated and may have been capitalised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were expecting a run rate of Rs 8 billion\nversus reported opex of Rs 3 billion, we estimate that ~Rs 5 billion may have been\ncapitalised from employee costs.CLSA (on employee costs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kotak Securities note said \u201cThe management indicated that a part of network costs and employee costs, related to non-wireless business were capitalized\u201d.The company also reported lower average tower rent costs due to self-owned towers and on the back of power and fuel efficiency. Analyst reports indicated that on average Jio paid a rent of Rs 13,000 per month versus the average industry rent of Rs 31,000 per month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRJIO\u2019s\noperating cost surprised positively with unit\nnetwork cost 49 percent lower than Idea\u2019s in Q1FY18 due to lower tower rentals and significantly\nlower subscriber acquisition cost riding its digital onboarding. We now estimate\nEBITDA breakeven in FY18 and have revised up FY19E EBITDA 144 percent to Rs 210 billion, assuming 9 percent higher subscribers, 5 percent higher\nARPU and 43 percent  EBITDA margin.\n\nEdelweiss Securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Reliance jio stands to benefit from a further lowering of costs starting Q3 as interconnect charges have been slashed to less than half, from 14 paise to 6 paise, by telecom regulator TRAI.In Q2 Jio reported a close to Rs 2,200 crore interconnect cost. That will decline by half starting Q3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. 50% Lower Depreciation Rate Than Competitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bigger impact on costs was due to a lower than anticipated depreciation charge.Reliance Jio has chosen a depreciation method different from that of its key competitors. It charged depreciation on assets based on a unit-of-production method, also understood as a usage-based method. In this, depreciation is calculated as per asset capacity utilised. Other telecom service providers such as industry leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Idea Cellular Ltd. charge depreciation on a straight-line method basis.This led to a depreciation rate of 3.25 percent on capitalised assets of just over Rs 1,45,000 crore versus the 7-8 percent rate accounted by other telecom companies, said the Kotak Securities note.JP Morgan calculated Jio\u2019s depreciation rate at 2 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso no depreciation was charged on assets worth Rs 62,000 crore belonging to the wireline business segment, said the CLSA note. These have not been capitalised as they are yet to start commercial operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Rs 1.45 trillion (Rs 1,45,000 crore) capitalised, Reliance has opted for unit of production\nmethod of depreciation rather than the typical Straight Line Method methodology for\ndepreciating electronics and spectrum which will form a big chunk of this\namount. Therefore, Reliance\u2019s depreciation in earlier years will be lower when\nactual network utilisation and throughput is much lower as compared to later\nyears when the network hits appropriate utilisation.CLSA\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nChina Development Bank has initiated insolvency proceedings against a second Anil Ambani-promoted firm, Reliance Telecom Ltd. at the National Company Law Tribunal.CDB sought to club the insolvency pleas initiated by other creditors of Reliance Telecom so that these matters could be heard together.

Jio should be able to maintain its revenue traction in the forthcoming quarters.Reduction in interconnection usage charges will help the company keep costs under control.Jio will realise the benefits of higher ARPU over the next 3-6 months which will lead to improvement in industry growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recent increase in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.\u2019s tariffs will increase its average revenue per user by up to 20 percent and is positive for the telecom sector which is seeing rapid consolidation, says a Philip Capital report.However, a Credit Suisse report has said that the new tariffs of Jio are still 65 percent lower than an average smartphone customer was paying before its launch which would continue to put pressure on average revenue per user of incumbents.\u201cThe company by reducing validity on the most popular Rs 399 plan to 70 days from 84 days will result in effective ARPU increase by 20 percent. The earlier Rs 399 plan with 84 days validity is now available for Rs 459 entailing a 15 percent ARPU increase. Thus effective ARPU will rise by 15-20 percent for Jio subscribers on the most popular plans,\u201d the Philip Capital report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Hikes Tariff For Popular 84-Day Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio should be able to maintain the revenue traction in the forthcoming quarters and reduction in interconnection usage charges, on the other hand, will help the company in keeping costs under control, it added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find that Jio is increasingly growing in confidence about its network and product quality and the pace of ARPU increases should sustain as the value offered by Jio still far exceeds the incumbent\u2019s plans by a significant margin.\n\nPhilip Capital Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio made its service dearer by about 15 percent for its popular 84-day plan at Rs 459 from October 19, under which subscribers get 1GB 4G data at high speed per day. The company restructured its various schemes by reducing their validity period.Philip Capital said that Jio will realise the benefits of higher ARPU over the next 3-6 months which would also lead to an improvement in industry growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian telecom industry is seeing a huge amount of consolidation and with decreasing choices for the subscribers, the operators will compete on quality of service over the medium to long-term. This could mean sustained increase in ARPU over the medium to long-term. We are highly optimistic on the prospects of the Indian telecom industry.\n\nPhilip Capital Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: How Reliance Jio Ended Up With Less Red In Q2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablished telecom sector players have seen huge reduction in their margins. Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications first time reported consolidated loss mainly on account of free services launched by Jio.The Credit Suisse said, even after the increase in cost of services, Jio\u2019s tariffs are still more than 65 percent below the ARPU levels which prevailed before the launch of Jio services.\u201cAt 20 percent increase every three months, we need at least 18 months for the smartphone customer segment to return to pre-Jio levels of ARPU. With over 65 per cent discount still running, we expect a downward pressure on ARPU for incumbents to continue,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: What Brokerages Make Of Reliance Jio\u2019s User Revenue Surprise\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nTelecom subscriber base in India reached 119 crore at the end of December 2017 with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. adding over 80 lakh new customers during the month, according to data published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of telephone subscribers in India increased from 118.5 crore at the end of November 2017 to 119.1 crore at the end of December 2017, thereby showing a monthly growth rate of 0.4 percent.TRAI Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth was led by mobile telephony segment with net additions of 49.7 lakh customers by five telecom operators Reliance Jio, Idea Cellular Ltd., Vodafone India Ltd., Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.Here\u2019s the list of telecom companies that added subscribers in December:Reliance Jio: Over 80 lakhIdea Cellular: 24.3 lakhsVodafone: 15 lakhsAirtel: 5.76 lakhsBSNL: 4.21 lakhsAlso Read: Reliance Jio Stands Out In A Gloomy Quarter For TelecomHere\u2019s the list of telecom companies that shed subscribers in December:Aircel Ltd.: 26.5 lakhsReliance Communications Ltd.: 23 lakhsTelenor India Communications Pvt.: 17.1 lakhsTata Teleservices Ltd.: 13 lakhsMTNL: 6,561Despite closure of mobile services, RCom was left with over 3.3 crore customers.

Total revenue was up 23.9 percent to Rs 1,01,169 crore.\"The Baa2 rating affirmation reflects our expectation that RIL's credit metrics will recover over the next 12-18 months and be better positioned for the ratings as it continues to increase its earnings from the recently completed and ongoing projects in the refining and petrochemical segments,\" said Vikas Halan, a vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody's and its lead analyst for RIL, said.The Baa2 ratings also reflect the strong ability of RIL to generate operating cash flows, with annual Ebitda exceeding $ 10 billion from its large-scale integrated refining and petrochemical operations with strong margins and its nascent but growing digital services business, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Industries Slips As Investors Weigh Q2 Earnings\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n#AskBQ is BloombergQuint\u2019s daily offering where market experts help investors make the right investment choice \u2014 be it in equities, commodities or the derivatives markets.On Monday\u2019s episode, Parthiv Shah,director at TRACOM Stock Brokers Pvt Ltd. and Kiran Jadhav, chairman and managing director of Kiran Jadhav & Associates gave their views on Reliance Industries, AB Capital, Idea Cellular and many more stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the full conversation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited excerpts from the conversation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkit Mishra: I bought 500 shares of Karnataka Bank at Rs 165 with a long-term view.

But it may take more than an aggressive tone to change the complex relationship between two economies that are joined at the hip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new national-security strategy released Monday, the White House lumped China with Russia as powers seeking to \u201cchallenge American power, influence, and interests,\u201d and attempting to erode the country\u2019s security and prosperity. \u201cWe will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest,\u201d Trump said in a speech in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new rhetoric contrasts with\u00a0the more collaborative approach of former President Barack Obama, who courted China as an economic partner even as the U.S. asserted its military power in Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder his America First approach to foreign policy, Trump says he will try to eliminate America\u2019s $500-billion total trade deficit by insisting on \u201cfair and reciprocal\u201d commerce with other nations, and strengthen the national security test for foreign investments. At the same time, Trump is juggling the more imminent need of working with China to address North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here, for more on the higher hurdles being proposed for foreign investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. strategy may convince China to ease some trade barriers, giving U.S. firms more access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. But it will be difficult to eliminate America\u2019s $309-billion trade shortfall with China without deeper reforms to the nature of each country\u2019s economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s because trade flows are heavily influenced by the amount that countries save and invest. When a nation invests more than it saves, as the U.S. does, it will import more than it exports, and finance the resulting current-account deficit by borrowing from abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cChina has lots of protections in place, so the U.S. has legitimate issues on market access,\u201d said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s economic emissary to China under Obama. \u201cBut even if they did everything we wanted, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily change the trade balance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and other countries have been pushing China for years to transition from an export-driven, state-led growth model to one more reliant on domestic consumption. For its part, the U.S. could take steps to increase savings, and therefore narrow the trade deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s official English-language newspaper China Daily sought to play down the accusation on Tuesday, saying in an editorial that the speech still recognizes that the two nations\u2019 interests are \"increasingly interwoven.\" Still, the editorial raised the prospect of \"exacerbated frictions over trade\", with Trump promoting economic strength as indispensable for national security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDollar Boost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepublican plans to cut taxes may undermine Trump\u2019s trade goals, by giving a short-term boost to the U.S. economy that strengthens the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive, said Eswar Prasad, a China expert at Cornell University. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s tough rhetoric on China is a cross-purposes with its own domestic and international economic policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalks between the U.S. and China through their main economic channel have stalled. But the two nations have little choice but to cooperate, given the intertwined nature of their economies, said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust look at the iPhone, which is produced in China with a lot of suppliers having moved to China to support production,\u201d Wessel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Trump has so far deferred specific measures to crack down on China\u2019s trade practices, his administration is considering tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and probing China\u2019s intellectual-property practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the administration chooses a more muscular course, then the Chinese authorities could retaliate or move toward the global moral high ground of using WTO and other existing mechanisms,\u201d Nathan Sheets, chief economist for PGIM Fixed Income, who served as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under Obama. \u201cMy hunch is it will probably be some of both.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Scrutiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, U.S. policy toward China has shifted to increasingly looking at trade issues through a security lens. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he\u2019s spending more time on sanctions and national security-related issues as the Treasury accelerates the use of sanctions to cut off North Korea\u2019s ties with the U.S. financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMnuchin has has urged closer vetting of foreign acquisitions by the security-review panel he chairs, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cfius, while maintaining an investor-friendly climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport is growing for strengthening Cfius. On Monday, Defense Secretary James Mattis joined Mnuchin and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in supporting proposed legislation led by Republican Senator John Cornyn calling for tougher security reviews for foreign investors seeking to acquire and invest in U.S. companies, particularly targeting China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Monday, before the launch of that security strategy in Washington, that U.S.-China trade ties are win-win and that China will continue to liberalize its trade and investment policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nReliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.\u2019s demand to make interconnect usage charges zero will benefit the country\u2019s youngest telecom company, according to most brokerages.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India may cut IUC charges from the existing 14 paise per minute to under 10 paise soon, according to a recent report by the Times of India.Lower IUC would benefit Reliance Jio the most, while it will hurt the top three telecom companies, broking firm IDFC Securities said in a research note. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled telecom company, which offers free voice calls, will save close to Rs 900-1,000 crore annually if IUC comes down to 10 paise a minute, it said.The note said Bharti Airtel Ltd., Idea Cellular Ltd. and Vodafone India Ltd.\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will fall by 4-5 percent on IUC cuts.Likewise, HSBC said a lower or zero IUC model suits Reliance Jio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4G entrant Jio\u2019s business model works best in a zero IUC regime as Jio offers unlimited and free voice and while IUC charges are above zero, its margins are capped.\n\nHSBC Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IUC Math\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterconnect usage charges are payable for cross-operator calls. For example, Reliance Jio will have to pay a fee for every call its subscriber makes to a Bharti Airtel Ltd. user, and vice versa.Which means, older operators with more subscribers and bigger networks tend to receive more calls and thus make money from the charge. A smaller rival like Reliance Jio that offers free calls becomes a net payer.Reliance Jio, which launched its services in September 2016, has paid close to Rs 2,600 crore as IUC for seven months. The company recently launched feature phones targeting voice-heavy customers. Reliance Jio will not receive any income from its free voice calls, while a variable expense like IUC could cap the company\u2019s margin.Reliance Jio wants IUC to be zero, while the top three incumbents are pushing for a hike to 35 paise per minute.

A paper released as part of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\u2018s \u2018Mint Street Memos\u2019 series shows that more than half of the new debt raised in 2016 was raised from outside the Indian banking sector.\u201cIn 2016, non-bank debt through corporate bonds, Commercial Paper (CPs) and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) accounted for more than half of the new debt funding,\u201d said the paper authored by Apoorva Javadekar, research director at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe share of new non-bank credit to total new debt has risen steadily from around 20 percent in 2015 to around 53 percent in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil about a decade ago, most firms relied on bank funding for their needs. 80 percent of new debt funding in 2005 was raised via domestic banks, the study showed. Since then, the dependence on the banking sector has reduced \u201cdramatically\u201d, says the study which adds that firms have opportunistically tapped foreign and domestic markets to borrow funds.The study notes that Indian corporates used ECBs heavily until 2012 but a depreciation in the Indian currency pushed firms to move back onshore for their borrowing needs. This has led to an expansion in funding via domestic debt instruments. CP issuances now constitute a significant segment and represent roughly 25 percent of non-bank credit, the study noted.The study comes at a time when the Indian banking sector is saddled with bad loans, impairing the ability of domestic lenders to lend afresh. As such, a diversification in funding sources may help prevent a shortage in supply of credit for industrial expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results indicate that corporate bond, ECB and CP market have allowed at least a subset of firms to diversify their funding sources. The ability to substitute the sources of financing is important to shield the economy from adverse real effects of a financial crisis.Mint Street Memos\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall and medium-sized firms with sound financials have been able to switch to market borrowings, said the study. It added that even large firms with weak financials have been able to tap funds via the debt market. \u201cThis leaves the subset of small firms with poor financials in a vulnerable situation,\u201d the study concluded.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nDay 1 Subscription (As of 5 pm)Qualified institutional buyers: 6.13 timesNon-institutional investors: 11.38 timesRetail investors: 0.9 timesOverall: 4.64 times\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s first asset management company Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. will list on the exchanges tomorrow after raising Rs 1,542 crore in its initial public offering.The joint venture between Reliance Capital Ltd. and Japan's Nippon Life Insurance Company Ltd. sold 6.12 crore shares at Rs 252 apiece in the IPO that was subscribed 81.5 times.

It announced last month\u00a0the collapse of its merger plans with rival Aircel Ltd., a deal which could have helped it pare debt and better compete with rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mobile carrier, whose\u00a0customer base of about 75 million people is dwarfed by Idea Cellular Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd., proposed earlier this week that lenders convert\u00a070 billion rupees\u00a0($1.1 billion) of debt into equity. In the past month, it also withdrew a regulatory document seeking a nod to sell its towers and faced another insolvency petition. The flagship company of the Reliance Group is in a so-called standstill period with its lenders, and isn\u2019t paying interest and principal on loans until December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe upcoming coupon on the bond is uncertain, given the continuing standstill agreement with local banks, recent developments around assets sales, and the new debt recast plan involving partial conversion to equity,\u201d said Abhishek Rawat, a director at China Merchants Securities Investment Management (HK) Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Reliance Communications spokesman said in response to emailed questions that he would reply on hearing back from management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about the company\u2019s plans to sell down assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm\u2019s earnings slumped after deep-pocketed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., backed by India\u2019s richest man and Ambani\u2019s older brother Mukesh, offered free calls and data plans last year. Amid a price war, the industry has faced consolidation and smaller players like\u00a0Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Reliance Communications are being forced to restructure borrowings and sell assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid fierce competition, the firm has retreated. Reliance Communications said Oct. 25 that it\u2019ll cut back its second- and third-generation wireless networks from Nov. 30, a move that\u2019s expected to reduce the value of towers the company owns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company said earlier this week that as much as 270 billion rupees of debt could be repaid by selling assets. It had net debt of 443.45 billion rupees, compared with cash and equivalents of 4.55 billion rupees as of March 31, according to its annual report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0$300 million of bonds on which the firm must pay the semi-annual coupon Monday mature in 2020. The price on the securities has plummeted to about 40.7 cents on the dollar, near a record low, from more than 100 cents just six months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the coupon is relatively small and could be covered by Reliance Communications, the risk of a \u201cnon-timely payment\u201d and the firm\u2019s smaller business scale could keep the valuations on its bonds under pressure, according to a Barclays Plc note dated Oct. 31.

In fact, between 2012 and 2016, there was no kindness at all.

Three telecom companies \u2013 Bharti Airtel Ltd., Idea Cellular-Vodafone India combine and Reliance Jio \u2013 are expected to account for more than 90 percent of the revenue market share by then, it said in a report.Reliance Jio had triggered a tariff war by offering free voice and data for the first six months of its operations that began in September last year. The resultant competition saw Bharti Airtel acquire Telenor\u2019s India business and 4G business of Tikona Networks.

This could hurt the earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 2-4 percent for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, according to Deutsche Bank. Normalisation of tariffs between Jio and other incumbents would help minimise the traffic asymmetry, it said.The government is also likely to increase the deferred spectrum payment tenor to 16 years from 10.

Merger with Vodafone India would lead to an annual savings of close to Rs 3,000 crore, largely through rationalisation of sites and lower subscriber acquisition costs. Idea has also committed to selling its stake in Indus Towers to bring down the debt of the merged company.Reliance JioWith a total investment of more than Rs 2 lakh crore, Reliance Jio is expected to have a market share of 25 percent by March 2021. Its newly launched JioPhone will allow the operator to service 50 crore feature-phone subscribers in India and drive adoption of 4G data, Deutsche Bank said. It expects that 10 crore subscribers could find the JioPhone proposition attractive.The impact on rivals would be limited because of Rs 153 a month price of the plan, a three-year lock-in and availability of handsets at Rs 2,000-2,500 in the market.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- When Apple Inc. dropped Imagination Technologies Group Plc as a supplier for iPhone technology, the British chip designer\u2019s shares plunged as much as 69 percent and the company ultimately accepted a buyout.

He said this is in contrast to Imagination, which designs technology for customers to manufacture themselves, rather than being a supplier of usable components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semiconductor industry has seen much consolidation over the past two years and the U.K. has been a notable target. In addition to Imagination\u2019s sale, U.K. chip designer ARM\u00a0Holdings Plc was snapped up by SoftBank Group Corp. for $32 billion. Elsewhere, Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV is the target of what was once the industry\u2019s biggest-ever deal when Qualcomm Inc. proposed a $47 billion buyout in November last year.

Jio, which is wholly owned by Reliance Industries, launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world\u2019s most crowded mobile markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt should get reflected in the current market price level for Reliance,\u201d Deven Choksey,\u00a0managing director of K.R.

Jio is also planning further market share gains: the company is selling a $23 handset that offers 4G data plans that cost as low as 23 rupees for two days or 153 rupees monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbani has a net worth of nearly $40 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Shares of Reliance Industries, whose operations span refining to retail, have jumped 69 percent this year to give the company a market value of about $92 billion.\u00a0India\u2019s stock benchmark index, the S&P BSE Sensex, rose 25 percent over the same period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benchmark index\u00a0in India is trading near an all-time high, which has helped fuel a record IPO haul in the country. First-time share sales in the country have raised 750 billion rupees ($11.6 billion) this year, more than double the previous record set in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaire\u00a0Sunil Mittal, who controls the country\u2019s No. 1 wireless operator Bharti Airtel, warned last month the price war in the Indian market could continue through the first half of 2018.

Revenue increased 12 percent sequentially to Rs 6,789 crore.Operating profit rose 82 percent to Rs 2,628 crore.Operating margin expanded nearly 15 percentage points to 38.2 percent.Reliance Jio earned an average revenue of Rs 154 per user during the three months.

(RCom) have reached out to the company to seek reassurance that deleveraging deals initiated by it are on track, two people with direct knowledge of the development told BloombergQuint. Lenders have turned nervous as a pending merger with Aircel Ltd. is yet to conclude and recent developments, such as a cut in interconnect charges, could worsen the financials of the telecom firm.According to the first person quoted above, lenders are worried that the merger with Aircel could be delayed due to creditor Ericsson India\u2019s decision to file an insolvency plea against Reliance Communications.In a stock exchange filing on September 13, Reliance Communications said Ericsson India has filed a petition under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to recover Rs 491.41 crore from the company. \u201cEricsson has also filed similar petitions against Reliance Infratel Limited and Reliance Telecom Limited, subsidiaries of the company for recovery of an amount of Rs 534.75 crore and Rs 129.34 crore respectively,\u201d the company disclosed.Lenders fear this could impact an earlier plan agreed upon in June. Back then, the company and its bankers had agreed to invoke strategic debt restructuring (SDR) to convert the company\u2019s debt into equity. Banks would hold this equity till pending deleveraging transactions and the proposed merger with Aircel concluded. Conversion of the debt to equity had allowed banks to defer additional provisioning on nearly Rs 22,000 crore in loans.Reliance Communications, on its part, has reassured lenders that it will complete pending transactions in time, said the bankers quoted above. The company is also confident that it will be able to negotiate a deal with operational creditors seeking to invoke insolvency provisions to recover dues, they said.In addition, banks involved in the RCom case have been bothered by the news that Aircel is considering insolvency as an option to deal with its own financial stress. According to the second person quoted above, Aircel is currently talking to its lawyers to see how it can utilize provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.Aircel has denied this. \"It is business as usual at Aircel, the company denies any move to file for bankruptcy,\" a spokesperson told BloombergQuint.If Reliance Communications is not able to complete the promised deals before December, lenders to the company will be forced to take over the company by converting debt to equity. Under the provisions of SDR, banks have six months to actually convert debt to equity following the invocation of the scheme. Lenders had used the scheme to prevent the account from turning non-performing, which would necessitate additional provisions.Meantime there has been little improvement in the operating environment for the company. If anything, recent regulatory changes could prove to be negative for the company.On Tuesday, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) reduced the interconnect usage charges to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise earlier. This move is expected to cause considerable pain to the voice calling businesses of all established network providers in India, said Fitch Ratings. \u201cThis will place further pressure on these companies, which are already facing unprecedented competition from (Reliance) Jio,\u201d the rating agency said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe last few months have seen a bitter battle in the telecom industry with the entry of the Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. In December last year, Ambani announced the extension of Jio\u2019s free services till March 31, after providing 90 days of promotional offers since the the launch last September.Chairman of Bharti Enterprises, Sunil Bharti Mittal, says the entry of a new player was bound to cause some degree of disruption, especially given the scale of investment and size of Reliance Jio's parent.

Consequently, the merger has \u201clapsed with mutual consent,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBillionaire Anil Ambani\u2019s Reliance and T. Ananda Krishnan\u2019s Aircel, a unit of Malaysia-based Maxis Communications Bhd., were due to complete the transaction this year. India\u2019s mobile carriers have been locked in a price war that had worsened with the entry of Ambani\u2019s older brother, India\u2019s richest person, into the market a year ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal would have created India\u2019s fourth-largest carrier and given the companies more room to pay down combined debt that soared to about 600 billion rupees ($9.2 billion) as of the end of last year. Aircel was one of several possible transactions that Ambani was pushing as a way to\u00a0reduce Reliance\u2019s debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications will consider an alternate plan to cut debt, which includes sharing and trading of its airwaves valued at about 190 billion rupees, the company said in the statement Sunday. It will also consider plans to monetize its real estate, tower and fiber businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparately, Reliance Communications expanded its board, adding Punit Garg, president of the telecom business, as an executive director and Manikantan V., the company\u2019s chief financial officer, as a director, it said in a statement Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Anil Ambani\u2019s planned asset sales here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks that lent to Ambani\u2019s companies have met with executives from the group to push for a reduction in debt by selling assets, people familiar with the matter, who didn\u2019t want to be named because the talks were private, have said. RCom, as the wireless unit is known, got a seven-month reprieve from lenders in June to raise money from deals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the terms of the proposed merger with Aircel, Reliance would have transfered more than 40 percent of its debt, or 200 billion rupees, to a new joint venture. Aircel, which is controlled by a unit of\u00a0Maxis Bhd., would have offloaded 40 billion rupees of debt to the venture. Maxis shares were little changed at 5.81 ringgit as of the close of Kuala Lumpur trading Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Krishnan,\u00a0Malaysia\u2019s third-richest person, a deal with Reliance would have helped him hedge some of the risk of vying for subscribers in India\u2019s fragmented mobile phone services market. Last year, an Indian court issued an arrest warrant for Krishnan over his alleged role in a years-old bribery scandal involving the purchase of mobile-phone airwaves -- allegations that the tycoon has denied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office of the chief operating officer of Usaha Tegas Sdn, Krishnan\u2019s closely held company, said by phone that it had no comment on the collapse of the Reliance deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the proposed merger were the rising difficulties of making money in a market that has some of the lowest phone rates in the world. One company responsible for escalating the rivalry is the market\u2019s newest entrant, Jio, which is controlled by Ambani\u2019s older brother Mukesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith India\u2019s larger mobile players battling for market share, smaller carriers are doomed in the long term, according to Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong. As of the end of July, Aircel was the sixth-largest operator in India with a 7.6 percent market share, followed by Reliance Communications with 6.9 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Reliance, which for years was the country\u2019s second-largest carrier, it\u2019s been a long descent. The company posted profit declines for six out of seven years before posting its first annual loss last fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe merger also faced difficulties because of creditors, who didn\u2019t all support the combination. One of the creditors, Ericsson AB, initiated an insolvency petition in September to recover dues of 11.6 billion rupees -- allegations that Reliance has said it plans to challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance continues to be under \u201ca standstill period\u201d till December 2018 and expects to complete debt-restructuring process as per rules, it said in the statement. Shareholders have approved the issue of equity shares to lenders by conversion of loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s financial markets are closed Monday for a national holiday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nMukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd. is expected to report its highest ever gross refining margin number in the last eight years.GRM, which indicates how much the company earned for converting every barrel of crude into fuel, is expected to rise 5 percent on a sequential basis to $12.5 per barrel, according to BloombergQuint\u2019s calculations.

It also provides a good cushion for volatile 2-wheeler sales. Meanwhile, Eicher Motors Ltd. may report muted number on back of stagnant volumes.Banks and Non-Bank LendersPublic sector banks may continue to drag private sector peers in the December quarter. State-run lenders may report lower slippages on improved asset quality, but but higher provisioning may continue. Lower treasury gains on higher bond yields may result in some banks reporting losses.Earnings of retail-heavy private sector banks are expected to be stable, while credit costs may rise for corporate heavy banks.

Housing finance companies like HDFC Ltd. and Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. will maintain momentum and vehicle financiers such as Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. will report better earnings.CementA low base as demand had fallen after demonetisation in the year-ago period will aid earnings.

East India exposure will help ACC Ltd. and Shree Cement Ltd., while Ultratech Cement Ltd. may be impacted by JP Associates\u2019 assets. South India players like India Cements Ltd. and Ramco Cements Ltd. will be hurt by sand shortage.Capital Goods, IndustrialsLarsen & Toubro Ltd. is expected to lead the pack due to improvement in the construction segment. Domestic capital expenditure cycle continues to remain weak, especially on the industrial front, so Thermax Ltd., Cummins India Ltd. and ABB India Ltd. are expected report muted earnings. Execution of orders for the Yadari thermal power plan may aid financials of BHEL Ltd.Ports, logistics and road companies will do well on a low base.Consumer GoodsRevenues of fast-moving consumer goods companies are expected to rise, continuing the trend that started in the second ended September. A low base may aid volume growth but the underlying volume trends are still subdued as rural demand remains impaired by weak agricultural growth.ITC Ltd. is likely to report subdued earnings due to the GST, while spiralling copra prices will dent Marico Ltd.\u2019s margins. Strong margin expansion is expected for Hindustan Unilever Ltd., while GM Breweries Ltd.\u2019s strong financials will keep alcohol stocks in the limelight.Information TechnologyThe October-December quarter is a seasonally soft for the Indian information technology firms, and there has been no change in the trends in banking, financial services and insurance sectors or even the U.S. market. Currency was largely neutral and there were no major margin headwinds or tailwinds. The trend of mid caps outperforming large caps will continue into the quarter.

He rose to general manager, then managing director and chief executive officer and added chairman to the clutch of titles in December 2003. In April 2012 he was also appointed group executive chairman. Under his chairmanship the company\u2019s revenue has grown from Rs 10,000 crore to over Rs 1 lakh crore. Also to his credit is L&T\u2019s diversification into information technology and financial services.Naik has been grooming his successor, SN Subrahmanyan, for almost two years now. Currently Subrahmanyan serves as deputy managing director and president and will take over as chief executive officer later in the year.It\u2019s not yet known who will be the next chairman, executive or otherwise. Before the interview to BloombergQuint, Naik, when asked if he would consider staying on as non-executive chairman, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be non-executive anything\u201d, insisting he prefers a clean break. But he\u2019s open to the idea of running the L&T Employees Welfare Foundation, a trust which owns a little over 12 percent of the company\u2019s shares. The Foundation serves as somewhat of a defense against hostile takeovers, L&T has seen three in just the past three decades. But the only real safeguard according to Naik is \u201can expensive share price\u201d - a maxim he often repeats.At 26 times one year forward earnings, the L&T stock is priced at a substantial premium to Asian peer group companies (7 - 17 times), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That should serve as some comfort to Naik, at a time when the Indian economy isn\u2019t doing much for his company\u2019s growth prospects. In this interview Naik discusses expanding to new geographies, the outlook for power, hydrocarbon and defense businesses and how financial year 2017-18 will shape up.

The cash equity gauge fell 0.5 percent Wednesday, erasing gains of as much as 1.2 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommodity Cues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index fell 1.2 percent, its biggest tumble in 12 weeks.West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed at $61.69 a barrel after falling 2.6 percent.Gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,315.49 an ounce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some events scheduled for the remainder of this week:The U.K.\u2019s monetary policy decision Thursday. The Bank of England may see Governor Mark Carney emphasize that continuing appreciation of the pound, which has strengthened almost 3 percent since the beginning of 2018, would help to contain inflation. This would stand in sharp contrast to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand which earlier Thursday said it expects its exchange rate to ease.Earnings season continues with reports from Philip Morris, L\u2019Oreal and Twitter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian ADRs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary Policy Review\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee today kept interest rates unchanged and maintained a neutral stance, even as it raised its inflation forecasts and reiterated a commitment to maintaining the headline inflation at close to 4 percent.The MPC, however, highlighted a number of upside risks to inflation, suggesting that a rate hike in the next financial year is now a real possibility. Five of the six MPC members voted for a status quo on rates. Michael Patra, executive director at the Reserve Bank of India, voted in favour of a 25-basis-point hike.ALSO READS:Taxes On Capital Impact Investment Decisions, Says RBI GovernorAre India\u2019s Bond Markets Out Of Sync With Monetary Policy?MPC Set To Hike Rates Soon?

The market breadth firmly tilted in favour of buyers. About 1,144 stocks advanced and 387 stocks declined on the NSE.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe 2018 edition of Auto Expo showcased some 50 electric vehicles, reflecting the buzz created by the government\u2019s proclaimed intention to sell only electric cars by 2030, to both reduce vehicular pollution and curb India\u2019s dependence on petroleum product imports.The displays signalled the industry\u2019s capability and eagerness to tap this new market. Just 0.02 percent of all new cars sold in India in 2016 were electric. In contrast, as many as 2.5 million conventional cars are sold every year, and a matching sales figure for EVs hints at a huge market.Based on road transport minister Nitin Gadkari\u2019s announcement that a policy dedicated to promoting and regulating EVs was in the works, EV manufacturers and sellers were expecting a policy and regulatory framework laying out a roadmap for creating an ecosystem comprising, most importantly, charging stations, as well as rolling out incentives for both manufacturing and purchasing EVs.However, the day after the event ended, on Feb. 15, Gadkari seemed to reverse course. \u201cThere is no need for any policy now,\u201d Gadkari said. \u201cWhat we need is just action plans,\u201d said Amitabh Kant, chief executive of government think-tank NITI Aayog, explaining Gadkari\u2019s stand. \u201cEveryday, new technology is coming into the market. Technology is always ahead of rules and regulations. And in India, it becomes very tough to change rules and regulations, so let there be just actions.\u201dOn Feb. 16, the heavy industries ministry issued a draft National Auto Policy for discussion, acknowledging the importance of green mobility but referring to EVs as just one among several alternatives such as vehicles run on biofuels, CNG and hydrogen. No specific timelines for targets, infrastructure building and incentives for any of these were outlined, and, most worryingly for EV makers, no plans were specified for aligning India\u2019s flagship EV programme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles, with the overall electric vehicle vision or with the domestic manufacturing programme, Make in India.\u201cWe are trying to figure out what went wrong,\u201d an official from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles told IndiaSpend, requesting anonymity. SMEV represents Indian manufacturers of electric vehicles and component makers. A mandate guiding the switchover to EVs is definitely required to speed up production, he added.The government\u2019s volte-face created near panic among EV makers, and analysts agreed a dedicated policy was essential.\u201cThe country needs a clear road map with timelines and role play on transition to electric vehicles, else it will just remain a dream,\u201d said Amit Bhatt, strategy head for integrated urban transport at World Resources Institute India, a think-tank.EVs have the potential to disrupt the mobility ecosystem, Bhatt said, adding that if the transition is done well, it can positively influence employment generation and the wider economy, in addition to addressing two most pressing issues of our time\u2013air pollution and climate change.Here\u2019s a look at how the government can remove speed-breakers from the road to scale-up of EV production and uptake.\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nSun Pharmaceutical\u2019s subsidiary Taro Pharma reported a strong performance during the previous quarter.Axis Bank board to meet on November 10 to consider raising funds.Three Pillars Pte. to sell up to 19.99 crore shares of Bharti Airtel in the range of Rs 473-480 per share.Akzo Nobel to divest India\u2019s specialty chemical business, likely to garner for Rs 320 crore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian equity benchmarks fell most in over a month on Tuesday, dragged by losses in pharma and energy shares.

Only J.P. Morgan and Citi hiked price targets, while others including BNP Paribas and Macquarie maintained their bearish view. Five brokerage  firms have a price target of anywhere between Rs 75 and Rs 122 per share on BHEL, suggesting significant downside from current levels of Rs 155.Here\u2019s a snapshot of what analysts had to say on their earnings note:\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThere are some sectors that have been a no-go for investors over the past few years. While infrastructure companies in the build-own-operate-transfer space and select real estate companies would top the list, capital goods stocks aren\u2019t far behind. Stocks like Thermax Ltd. (peak price of Rs 1,297 a share on March 10, 2015) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (peak price of Rs 297 a share on February 3, 2015) have been big laggards. And not without reason. Thermax\u2019s revenue has fallen from Rs 5,395 crore in March 2015 to Rs 4,483 crore by March 2017. BHEL has not set the stage on fire either, with the last quarter\u2019s results showing revenue remaining flat and negative EBITDA. The scenario for TD Power Systems Ltd., ABB India Ltd., or Siemens Ltd. has not been too rosy either. However, the trick in investing is always about catching the cycle at its bottom. The question then is: is this the bottom of the cycle for capital good companies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSectors which have been dormant for the last few years have started showing signs of expansion and activity, resulting in order inflows for some capital good companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of orders are coming from outside India, which makes some capital goods companies less dependant on the Indian government orders coming through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate companies have started announcing capital expenditure plans.Ramco Cements Ltd. recently announced a Rs 1,000 crore expansion plan.Fertiliser companies have announced expansion plans after almost 6-7 years.Oil and gas companies have announced refinery upgrades, and have already placed orders with capital goods companies, with strong signs of more orders in the pipeline.If this trend broadens, it will come as a big relief for a sector that has been reeling with cash flow issues and order inflow reduction. Thermax is dealing with the sales degrowth by reducing costs and improving its product mix. This has resulted in a margin improvement - from 10.71 percent in 2014-15 (FY15) to 11.49 percent in FY17. Thermax\u2019s free cash flow has been positive in the last three years, despite the challenges. Remember, during the previous capex cycle, from FY06 to FY08, the growth in profit after tax for companies like Thermax was over 50 percent. Not all companies have been able to undertake the exercise that Thermax has. But the fact that after a long break, the otherwise dormant sector has started showing activity, and that international order flows are also making their way to Indian companies, is the boost that this sector needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat also makes this pocket of the market interesting is that it is under-owned.

This year, there\u2019s one at home.The first Mumbai Shopping Festival, modelled around similar events in Dubai, Singapore and Istanbul, kicked off in the second week of January. This weekend, apart from a variety of live performances across the city, there was also a night bazaar.\u201cSome of the best shopping festivals in the world have 8,000-9,000 retailers who participate. If we take one geography in Mumbai; if I take Crawford Market, or a Malad, we\u2019ll have 15,000 retailers here,\u201d said Rahul Gomes, the head of Oaks Management Consultancy, the event management firm that\u2019s organising the festival. \u201cThe intent is to grow this into the largest shopping festival in the world, because we have the population here. We have family, we all have friends, who fly down to Mumbai to shop.\u201dThis year, the festival is spread over three weekends. As an experiment, it\u2019s been a success, Gomes said.On the first weekend, as many as 45,000 people visited the night market along the Worli seaface. If the crowd at 10 p.m. at Malad\u2019s Inorbit Mall was any indicator, the footfall on Friday night would far exceed that number.The recent amendment to the Shops and Establishments Act by the Maharashtra government allowing businesses to stay open at night has already started benefiting retailers, said Rajat Bhargava, head of Inorbit Mall. \u201cThe Christmas weekend and the New Year weekend, we were open past midnight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat has helped a lot. Retailers are now participating in keeping shops open till midnight for sure. They\u2019ve started doing it on the weekends. As the awareness grows, you\u2019re going to have more people visiting.Rajat Bhargava, Head,  Inorbit Mall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe festival gave several foodtrucks an opportunity to ply their trade. Rules don\u2019t allow such trucks in public places in Mumbai. But a mall is considered a private property. So, at the Inorbit Mall night bazaar, visitors were treated to foodtrucks serving everything from maggi bhel to a fusion of Malayali and North Indian cuisines. From the look of it, they did brisk business.Also on offer were Maharashtrian traditional wares and several families had set up stalls. Even an amateur magician was entertaining children.Will the festival in the world\u2019s fourth most populous city weave its magic in the years to come? Dubai will be watching!\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nThe Nifty Futures on the Singapore Exchange, an early indicator of Nifty performance in India, declined 0.3 percent to 8,817.Yesterday, Indian shares gained for a sixth straight month, led by banks and auto companies, as global funds remained buyers despite the prospect of U.S. borrowing costs rising.  \nHere are all the stocks to watch today\nReliance Industries, ONGC: AP Shah panel says the two oil firms knew about continuity of the gas reservoirAuto companies to release August car sales dataBharti Airtel: May consider listing Nigerian unitCCI imposes penalty on 10 cement firms for cartelizationHCC: Says debt to reduce to half with cabinet decision on arbitration awardIndian Oil Corp, HPCL, BPCL: Raises gasoline, diesel pricesNMDC: To bid for iron ore mines in KarnatakaTata Motors: Court orders return of West Bengal landHindalco rated new underperform at Macquarie ResearchTata Power: Javelin JV looks to develop missile systemThermax: Invested Rs 6 crore to raise stake in First Energy to 54.67 percentUniply Industries: To acquire architecture firm Vector Projects for Rs 64 croreAxis Bank: Goldman Sachs sold 13.2 million shares yesterday; Integrated Core sold 16.8 million; Ishares India Index bought 12 million shares, NSE saysBHEL: India Ratings downgrades AA+; outlook negativeC&C Constructions: Wins order valued at Rs 73.61 crore from Power GridGlaxoSmithKline Pharma: Considering options for Thane land saleInterGlobe, Jet Airways, SpiceJet: IOCL cuts jet fuel price by 3.8 percent in Delhi from todayBPCL refining margin seen at $5-$5.5 a barrel in FY17, Chairman saysKEC International: Wins new orders valued at Rs 1220 crore from India, Thailand, BangladeshMercator: Executive Vice Chairman Atul Agarwal resignsNava Bharat Ventures: Trades ex-bonusNestle India: Nestle Nigeria has \u201csupply challenges\u201d and not problem with demandNMDC: To bid for iron ore mines in Karnataka, Rao saysPhoenix Mills: Report of mall stake sale speculativePraj Industries: Closes Praj Sur America SRL in ArgentinaRS Software: Develops Bharat Bill Payment System\u2019s central unitSurya Roshni: Report of Warburg, Bain buying unit speculativeYes Bank: Goldman Sachs sold 2.12 million shares yesterday, Integrated Core sold 3.21 million; Ishares India Index bought 2.37 million shares, NSE says\n\n\n\n\n\nWhose gas is it anyways?@TweshMishra reportshttps://t.co/IaKaqOSoa5\u2014 BloombergQuint (@BloombergQuint) August 31, 2016\n\n\n\n", "\n\n\n\nBharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. surged as much as 5.6 percent after the government-owned company delivered better-than-expected earnings in the July-September quarter.Net profit came in at Rs 109 crore compared to a net loss of Rs 180.8 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, the company said in its filing to the stock exchanges.
