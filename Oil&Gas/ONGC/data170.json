{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India has\u00a0tweaked the terms for sale of its shares in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to the country\u2019s biggest explorer to avoid a mandatory open offer to minority shareholders, according to people with knowledge of the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPCL \u201cwill continue to be controlled by the government\u201d through\u00a0Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management said in a\u00a0clarification on its website. The amendment to the terms will avoid triggering an open offer, which would have dragged the completion of the transaction and increased ONGC\u2019s payout, said the people, who asked not to be identified citing rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is aiming to complete the transaction this financial year as part of its plan to achieve the target of over $11 billion from asset sales in the year ending March. The sale of its 51.11 percent holding in HPCL can fetch Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration about 330 billion rupees at today\u2019s price, about half of its annual share sale aim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC is expected to get the final approval from its board within three months, according to the people. The state-run explorer may borrow about 250 billion rupees for funding the transaction, they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state oil explorer may have to pay the government a price equivalent to the six-month average trading price of HPCL shares, the people said.\u00a0ONGC and HPCL spokesmen were not available for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India Is Said to Tweak HPCL Share Sale Terms to Skip Open Offer\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-08-10 02:30:00"}
