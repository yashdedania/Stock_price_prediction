{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp.\u2019s push into new products is helping bolster sales and earnings in the second half of the year, even as the chipmaker\u2019s dependence on the lackluster personal-computer and server markets is keeping growth in check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue and profit were stronger than analysts estimated in the third quarter, and sales in the current period will be about $16.3 billion, the company said. While that\u2019s ahead of projections, it would still leave revenue little changed from the same period a year earlier, underscoring how difficult it is for the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker to expand total sales while its largest business stagnates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to spread Intel\u2019s bets more widely by adding new products that will make the company\u2019s chips essential in areas such as self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. He\u2019s managing that transition while still relying on a PC market that has shrunk every year since 2011, and a server-chip business that\u2019s dependent on the capital spending plans of a handful of companies to generate a large portion of its profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are going through a transformation,\u201d said Betsy Van Hees, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets in San Francisco. She recommends buying the stock. \u201cThey\u2019re handling it and realigning the organization in the face of a very challenging environment when their core business is on a secular decline.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel shares rose about 2 percent in extended trading following the announcement, after closing at $41.35 in regular New York trading. The stock has lagged behind peers this year with a 14 percent gain, less than half of the 36 percent advance by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross margin will be about 63 percent in the fourth quarter. That prediction and the sales forecast, which\u00a0includes a range of plus or minus $500 million, compare with average analysts\u2019 estimates for $16.1 billion in revenue and margin of 62.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird-quarter results got a lift from robust growth in Intel\u2019s memory-chip and internet of things units. Net income rose to $4.5 billion, or 94 cents a share, from $3.4 billion, or 69 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Sales climbed 2 percent to $16.1 billion. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.01 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 80 cents in profit on revenue of $15.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s management said on a conference call they will try to tighten spending and reduce annual operating expenses to 30 percent of revenue by 2020, helping extend gains by the stock. The company reduced costs in the recent quarter to below that level through a change in the way it accounts for marketing subsidies paid to PC makers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, market researchers said the PC market lost ground again in the third quarter, with shipments falling 3.6 percent. The latest results were hampered because the back-to-school season didn\u2019t provide its traditional boost in demand, Gartner Inc. said. Industry shipments peaked in 2011 at 363.8 million. In 2016 they were more than 100 million units short of that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen declining growth but relatively stable. Our unit volume in the quarter was a little bit better than that, \u201d said Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan. \u201cConsumers are continuing to pay up for high-performance products. Our average selling prices are up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntel\u2019s PC chip unit had sales of $8.9 billion, flat from a year earlier. In PCs, Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Swan said the market\u2019s competitive dynamics haven\u2019t changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $4.9 billion, an increase of 7 percent. Krzanich has said that business can achieve growth of more than 10 percent over the long term. Its performance is increasingly dependent on orders from cloud companies such as Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s web services unit. Their data centers are expanding at the expense of in-house server farms at corporations that are outsourcing their computing needs to providers of services over the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin that division, sales from data-center operators were up 24 percent in the quarter, helping making up for a 6 percent decline in revenue from corporations, the company said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of Intel\u2019s newer businesses, memory and internet of things, registered sales growth of 37 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Still, the impact of that growth was limited because those divisions are each only about a 10th the size of the PC-chip business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Intel's Lingering Reliance on PCs Keeps Sales Growth Subdued\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-29 07:18:00"}
