{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nThe oil ministry has formed all-powerful review committees to monitor performance of ONGC and Oil India. They will have the power to relinquish any oil and gas field for auctioning to private firms.Being dubbed \u2018super-boards\u2019, the committees will be headed by the ministry\u2019s upstream nodal authority Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), and will review and monitor performance in areas given to Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) on nomination basis.The two panels, one each for ONGC and OIL, will review these areas: annual work programme and budget, declaration of a discovery as commercial, reservoir and production performance, monitoring of development activities, and collaborations with other explorers.\u201cThe advice/decision of the Review Committee shall be implemented forthwith by the NOC (National Oil Company) concerned and the progress of implementation shall be reported to the Review Committee through DGH at its next meeting,\u201d the order dated May 25 quoted Atanu Chakraborty, director general, DGH, as saying.\u201cThey have all the powers to do so. We have to live with it,\u201d said a senior official at one of the two explorers. \u201cIf they want to create a \u2018super-board\u2019 so be it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order follows the ministry\u2019s unhappiness with state explorers particularly on delays in projects linked to output enhancement. It has already ordered a detailed review of board of directors of ONGC for a possible revamp of the functional heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe panels will be headed by DG, DGH and will have two other members from DGH - one Deputy DG and another head of Division in charge of NOCs-monitoring. One representative of ONGC or OIL not below the rank of director will be nominated by the NOCs.Also, the manager of the asset that is under review would be co-opted as member of the committee, the order said.ONGC produced 86 per cent of its 26.13 million tonnes of crude oil in financial year 2016-17 from fields given to it on nomination basis. Natural gas production from nomination fields accounted for 93 per cent of the total output of 25.34 billion cubic meters.In the order for \u2018Constitution of Review Committees for Management of Oil and Gas Resources of Nomination Fields of National Oil Companies (NOCs)\u2019, Chakraborty said the panels are being constituted drawing from powers given to DGH by the oil ministry orders.The order for the constitution of the committees will \u201ccome into force with immediate effect,\u201d he said.The review committee will meet at least once every three months.The powers of the panels include \u201cannual work programmes and budgets in respect of exploration operations and any modification and revisions thereto\u201d and \u201cannual work programme and budgets in respect of development and production operations and any modifications and revisions thereto.\u201d It will also review \u201cproposals for surrender or relinquishment of any part of the area included in the nomination field.\u201dFields relinquished by NOCs are auctioned to private firms by the government. The first such auction was concluded last financial year, with 67 fields relinquished by ONGC/OIL being put on sale.\u201cPerformance of non-producing/sub-optimally producing\u201d fields as well as \u201creservoir and production performance of producing fields\u201d would also be reviewed by the panels, the order said.Field development plans (FDP) and feasibility reports of commercial discoveries in nomination fields, and monitoring of development activities for early monetisation will also fall within the ambit of the committees.\u201cProposals for \u2018field surveillance\u2019 by DGH for better reservoir management\u201d will also be under preview of the committees, the orders said, adding collaboration with licensees or contractors of other areas would be as reviewed.Also, proposals for an appraisal programme or revision, declaration of a discovery as commercial discovery along with proposed development areas will be function of the panels.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Oil Ministry Forms Super Board To Monitor ONGC, Oil India\u2019s Performance\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-06-05 01:30:00"}
