Verma told reporters in Mumbai on Tuesday. The Indian oil company is now waiting for feedback from Tehran, Verma said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia has been weighing investments in Iran worth up to $20 billion. In addition to oil and gas exploration, the South Asian nation has considered petrochemical plants, gas-processing facilities and port expansions, including the industrial hub of Chabahar, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last year during a visit to Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIran is seeking foreign investment to revive its oil, gas and petrochemical industries since international sanctions on its economy were removed last year. Output from Farzad-B could range from 1 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, Verma said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent company Oil & Natural Gas Corp., which is up 34 percent in the past year, rose 0.4 percent to settle at 185.80 rupees Monday.
