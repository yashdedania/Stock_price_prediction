The earlier Rs 399 plan with 84 days validity is now available for Rs 459 entailing a 15 percent ARPU increase. Thus effective ARPU will rise by 15-20 percent for Jio subscribers on the most popular plans,\u201d the Philip Capital report said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Hikes Tariff For Popular 84-Day Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJio should be able to maintain the revenue traction in the forthcoming quarters and reduction in interconnection usage charges, on the other hand, will help the company in keeping costs under control, it added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find that Jio is increasingly growing in confidence about its network and product quality and the pace of ARPU increases should sustain as the value offered by Jio still far exceeds the incumbent\u2019s plans by a significant margin.\n\nPhilip Capital Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Jio made its service dearer by about 15 percent for its popular 84-day plan at Rs 459 from October 19, under which subscribers get 1GB 4G data at high speed per day. The company restructured its various schemes by reducing their validity period.Philip Capital said that Jio will realise the benefits of higher ARPU over the next 3-6 months which would also lead to an improvement in industry growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian telecom industry is seeing a huge amount of consolidation and with decreasing choices for the subscribers, the operators will compete on quality of service over the medium to long-term. This could mean sustained increase in ARPU over the medium to long-term. We are highly optimistic on the prospects of the Indian telecom industry.\n\nPhilip Capital Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: How Reliance Jio Ended Up With Less Red In Q2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablished telecom sector players have seen huge reduction in their margins. Idea Cellular and Reliance Communications first time reported consolidated loss mainly on account of free services launched by Jio.The Credit Suisse said, even after the increase in cost of services, Jio\u2019s tariffs are still more than 65 percent below the ARPU levels which prevailed before the launch of Jio services.\u201cAt 20 percent increase every three months, we need at least 18 months for the smartphone customer segment to return to pre-Jio levels of ARPU. With over 65 per cent discount still running, we expect a downward pressure on ARPU for incumbents to continue,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: What Brokerages Make Of Reliance Jio\u2019s User Revenue Surprise\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Jio Rate Hike Positive For Telecom Sector As Pressure Continues\u00a0\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-10-23 02:30:00"}
