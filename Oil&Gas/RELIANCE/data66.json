{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Reliance Communications Ltd.,\u00a0the Indian mobile phone operator controlled by\u00a0billionaire Anil Ambani, faces a bond coupon deadline Monday after temporarily halting payments to lenders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interest payment of about $9.75 million is the latest test for the debt-laden company, which has faced a series of setbacks amid a shakeout in the world\u2019s second-largest telecom market. It announced last month\u00a0the collapse of its merger plans with rival Aircel Ltd., a deal which could have helped it pare debt and better compete with rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mobile carrier, whose\u00a0customer base of about 75 million people is dwarfed by Idea Cellular Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd., proposed earlier this week that lenders convert\u00a070 billion rupees\u00a0($1.1 billion) of debt into equity. In the past month, it also withdrew a regulatory document seeking a nod to sell its towers and faced another insolvency petition. The flagship company of the Reliance Group is in a so-called standstill period with its lenders, and isn\u2019t paying interest and principal on loans until December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe upcoming coupon on the bond is uncertain, given the continuing standstill agreement with local banks, recent developments around assets sales, and the new debt recast plan involving partial conversion to equity,\u201d said Abhishek Rawat, a director at China Merchants Securities Investment Management (HK) Co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Reliance Communications spokesman said in response to emailed questions that he would reply on hearing back from management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about the company\u2019s plans to sell down assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm\u2019s earnings slumped after deep-pocketed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., backed by India\u2019s richest man and Ambani\u2019s older brother Mukesh, offered free calls and data plans last year. Amid a price war, the industry has faced consolidation and smaller players like\u00a0Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Reliance Communications are being forced to restructure borrowings and sell assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid fierce competition, the firm has retreated. Reliance Communications said Oct. 25 that it\u2019ll cut back its second- and third-generation wireless networks from Nov. 30, a move that\u2019s expected to reduce the value of towers the company owns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company said earlier this week that as much as 270 billion rupees of debt could be repaid by selling assets. It had net debt of 443.45 billion rupees, compared with cash and equivalents of 4.55 billion rupees as of March 31, according to its annual report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0$300 million of bonds on which the firm must pay the semi-annual coupon Monday mature in 2020. The price on the securities has plummeted to about 40.7 cents on the dollar, near a record low, from more than 100 cents just six months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the coupon is relatively small and could be covered by Reliance Communications, the risk of a \u201cnon-timely payment\u201d and the firm\u2019s smaller business scale could keep the valuations on its bonds under pressure, according to a Barclays Plc note dated Oct. 31. There are also execution risks to the company\u2019s debt resolution plan, it added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more: Nomura said valuations for tower business to be lower due to canceled Aircel merger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mobile carrier delayed payments on local notes earlier this year.\u00a0Fitch Ratings cut its credit score to \u201crestricted default\u201d in June and said that multiple waivers or forbearance periods had been extended following a non-payment event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Communications Faces Coupon Test Amid Standstill\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-07 08:35:00"}
