{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India\u2019s central government will transfer its stake in state-run refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to the country\u2019s biggest oil explorer as part of its plans to create an integrated oil company, The Economic Times newspaper reported, citing people it didn\u2019t identify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will issue a proposal for approval by the country\u2019s cabinet to transfer its 51.11 percent of HPCL to state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the newspaper reported. The stake is worth about $4.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ONGC Chairman D.K. Sarraf declined to comment Monday, adding that \u201call our investment plans are intact.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move is part of the country\u2019s plans to merge state-run energy companies into larger entities to match the might of international companies. India is overtaking Japan as the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer and will be the center of global demand growth through 2040, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPCL spokesman S. Ramaswamy couldn\u2019t immediately comment on the news. Rahul Gowlikar,\u00a0assistant director at the government\u2019s Press Information Bureau, who looks after media for the oil ministry, didn\u2019t answer two calls to his office seeking comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHPCL would add 23.8 million tons of annual crude refining capacity to ONGC\u2019s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after Indian Oil Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. ONGC is majority owner of Mangalore Refineries & Petrochemicals Ltd., which operates a 15 million-ton-a-year refinery in southern India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC gained as much as 1 percent, while HPCL fell as much as 1.1 percent as of 9:40 a.m. in Mumbai. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex added 0.1 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India Seeks to Transfer $4.4 Billion HPCL Stake to ONGC, ET Says\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-02-28 04:43:00"}
