{"text": "\n\n\n\nBharat Heavy Electrical Ltd\u2019s (BHEL) issuer rating was placed under negative watch by India Ratings, the agency said in a press release on Wednesday. The negative watch was triggered due to the decline in the company\u2019s key business parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state-owned company saw its revenue fall by 47 percent over the last three financial years, according to the credit ratings agency\u2019s release. Provisional figures for FY16 also suggested a 15 percent year-on-year decline in revenue to Rs 25,100 crore. India Ratings attributes the decline in revenue to lower order intake over FY12-FY15 as well as the presence of slow-moving projects worth nearly Rs 50,000 crore in its order book as at FY16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHEL\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin also faced serious contraction, as reflected in the provisional FY16 figures, the agency said. The company had a cash balance of Rs 10,000 crore at the end of FY16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia Ratings expects to resolve the negative watch in July 2016, when BHEL\u2019s ratings will be either downgraded or affirmed.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        BHEL on India Ratings\u2019 Negative Watch Following Weak Financials\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-07-06 08:39:00"}
