{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Order a curry in southern India and the waiter might just stare at you for a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dishes we know and love as curry\u2014fish, meat or vegetables\u00a0flavored with glorious spices\u2014have individual names back home on the Indian subcontinent. But the idea of curry\u00a0has conquered the globe and is an international favorite.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word \u201ccurry\u201d might derive\u00a0from the Tamil word kari\u00a0for a side dish with rice, or it might be based on the old English word cury, referring to a stew.\u00a0An English cookbook, The Forme of Cury, was published in the 1390s. All hot food was called \u201ccury\u201d from the French word cuire, meaning to cook, according to the BBC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to find the best curry, or other Indian foods? We\u00a0asked leading chefs to name some of their local favorites.\u00a0We shamelessly expanded the definition of curry to encompass snacks, kebabs, biryanis,\u00a0and whatever else they fancied, along with the saucy creations that Anglophones lump together under the term curry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are their\u00a0picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncle Cafe, GuangzhouChef Andrew Wong of A Wong restaurant in London is a fan of this informal restaurant in the Hensheng Commercial Centre. \u201cI ordered the mutton curry and enjoyed it a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s Pakistani-style, with robust spicing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDubai\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndego by VineetVineet Bhatia\u00a0is one of the world\u2019s most respected Indian chefs, and this beautiful restaurant at the Grosvenor House hotel can hardly be described as a hidden gem. You can dine on a terrace overlooking the Dubai Marina. U.K.-based chef Romy\u00a0Gill,\u00a0of Romy\u2019s Kitchen,\u00a0can\u2019t resist going back for his starter of 3 Chaats\u00a0vegetarian nibbles.\u00a0\u201cThese snacks were a very important part of growing up in India,\u201d\u00a0she says.\u00a0\u201cThe flavors dance in your mouth, and the dish is beautifully presented.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent BiryaniThis Pakistani fast-food chain, which was founded in 1969, has three outlets in Dubai. The meal deals and garish decor might put you off, but the food is very good. \u201cThe Bihari\u00a0Kebab is the star of the show,\u201d says Chef Vivek Singh of Cinnamon Club in London. \u201cThey use\u00a0chicken on the bone, marinated in a paste of fried onions, garlic, ginger, papaya and chili for hours, then cooked over low charcoal embers. It\u2019s one\u00a0of the finest kebabs I have ever eaten.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaheli, KolkataThis smart Bengali restaurant is housed in the Peerless Inn, a luxury hotel in the heart of the city. It\u2019s the pick of\u00a0Chef Abdul\u00a0Yaseen\u00a0of Darbaar restaurant in London. He enjoys the\u00a0bhapa ilish, steamed fish like salmon, in yogurt and spices. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic Bengali dish and this is as authentic as it gets,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh fish from the Bay of Bengal with fresh ingredients. You will fall in love with it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsalan\u00a0(Circus Avenue branch), KolkataThis popular mini-chain of eight restaurants serves Mughal food from north India. It\u2019s bright, it\u2019s brash and it\u2019s been popular since the first branch opened in 2002.\u00a0Harneet Baweja,\u00a0of Gunpowder restaurant in London, is\u00a0a fan of the mutton biryani rice dish. \u201cI love the potatoes as much as the meat in the biryani,\u201d he says. \u201cI like the Calcutta style with its subtle flavors and slow-cooked pieces of meat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBademiya, MumbaiThis is a legendary late-night food stall near the Taj Hotel.\u00a0\u201cPeople order their kebabs & breads and enjoy them while standing on the street or using their car bonnet as a table,\u201d chef Vineet Bhatia says. \u201cMy favorites are lamb\u00a0brain & liver masala with roomali roti (handkerchief bread), finished off with a shahi tukda\u00a0(Indian bread pudding) which is\u00a0light and divine.\u201d\u00a0London-based chef Atul Kochhar of Benares restaurant in London is another fan. He goes for the chicken reshmi tikka.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/-ZLFlPrbC1/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBhel\u00a0Puri\u00a0at Juhu\u00a0Beach, MumbaiThis beachside seafood stand is a destination for food lovers in Mumbai, including Bhatia, who grew up in Juhu. His favorite dish is bhel puri\u00a0puffed rice tossed with green chili, coriander, onion and fine\u00a0sev (gram flour)\u00a0vermicelli. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience to eat this at the beach as the wind blows and the seawater tides clash and the water sprays on you,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBukhara, New DelhiThis is a very posh Indian restaurant in the luxurious ITC Maurya hotel. It\u2019s about as far from being a hidden gem as the Koh-i-Noor diamond, and Bill Clinton is among the many world leaders who have dined there. (Just don\u2019t\u00a0call it a curry house.) You don an apron and eat with your hands. The meaty barrah\u00a0kebab is the pick of chef Karam\u00a0Sethi, of Gymkhana, in London. Chunks of leg of lamb and chops are marinated\u00a0in yogurt, malt vinegar and other spices before being char-grilled. \u201cThey are the best lamb chops in the world,\u201d\u00a0he says. Gunpowder\u2019s\u00a0Harneet Baweja is another fan. He goes for the dal, a blend of black lentil, tomatoes, ginger and garlic, simmered overnight and finished with cream. \u201cIt is decadent and could easily be my last meal,\u201d Baweja\u00a0says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDum Pukht, New DelhiThis is the other posh restaurant at the ITC Maurya hotel in New Delhi. It specializes in the historic royal cuisine of the rulers of Awadh, in north India. Dum phukt is a method of slow cooking in sealed containers for deep flavors. This richly decorated room\u00a0is Kochhar\u2019s pick. \u201cTheir lamb biryanis are to die for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best place in the world to have biryani.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKabab-e-Bahar, HyderabadKochhar also likes this lakeside restaurant in the Taj Banjara\u00a0hotel. The lamb shikampuri kebabs, with patties of finely minced lamb with roast gram flour, \u201care very moreish,\u201d he says. \u201cHyderabad is the city where they specialize in creamed paneer stuffed kebabs. They are delicious.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaffer Bhai\u2019s Delhi Darbar\u00a0(Dongri branch), MumbaiThis brightly lit and inexpensive mini-chain is a favorite of\u00a0Gunpowder restaurant\u2019s Baweja. He likes to order\u00a0dabba ghosht, which\u00a0features cubes of mutton in a mild gravy, garnished with egg and salt. \u201cIt\u2019s melt-in-your-mouth,\u201d\u00a0he says. \u201cThe restaurant is an old-school joint with regulars that have been coming for years.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-322211172/bloombergs-richard-vines-on-the-best-curries-in-the-world/s-7uYek\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Kulfi\u00a0Centre, MumbaiThis Indian ice-cream shop near Marine Drive has been popular for decades. \u201cThey serve the best kulfis\u00a0I\u00a0have ever had,\u201d Bhatia says of the Indian dessert. \u201cMy favorite is the paan kulfi: betel leaf filled with coconut, dates, betel nut, fennel\u2014basically a mouth freshener. People specially drive down and\u00a0wait in cars while the staff come over to take your orders and serve you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh! Calcutta, PuneThis award-winning restaurant is styled on the colonial clubs of\u00a0old Calcutta, serving traditional Bengali cuisine. It\u2019s the pick of Darbaar\u2019s Yaseen, whose favorite dishes include bhapa ilish\u00a0fish, marinated with fermented mustard paste and fresh green chillis, then wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. \u201cThe flavors take me to the river banks and the fish market from where my aya\u00a0(house maid) used to bring freshly caught fish to be prepared at home,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTunday\u00a0Kababi, LucknowThis famous and lively cafe\u00a0traces its history to 1905. The\u00a0minced buffalo-meat galouti\u00a0kebab is a favorite of Gymkhana\u2019s Sethi. \u201cYou can eat them\u00a0in the restaurant or have them delivered to your car window,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are rich, heady, spiced kebabs originally made for toothless royals\u2014the world\u2019s most\u00a0moreish kebab.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMunnar, Tel AvivIndian food isn\u2019t big in Israel, but London-based chef\u00a0Eyal Jagermann from the\u00a0Barbary\u00a0reckons it\u2019s worth seeking out Munnar, a popular vegetarian restaurant. \u201cI remember having a\u00a0Swiss chard and kale curry served with paratha roti, brown chickpeas stew with daal and chutney,\u201d Jagermann says. \u201cEverything was served with spiced yogurt, and it was fantastic.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJiyuken,\u00a0OsakaOsaka\u2019s oldest Western restaurant is\u00a0famous for its curries.\u00a0It\u2019s the pick of London-based chef Yoshinori\u00a0Ishii, who holds two Michelin stars at Umu. His favorite dish is the meibutsu (specialty) curry, which contains beef, onion, spices and vegetables, stewed down and then mixed with white rice.\u00a0It is served with a raw egg on top. \u201cWhenever I am in Osaka, I visit this small place, which brings back childhood memories,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very much home-style cooking with simple, subtle\u00a0flavors.\u00a0If I am hungry, I order a side of beef and potato croquettes or curried beef cutlets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiseido\u00a0Parlour, TokyoThis Ginza dining room, owned by the cosmetics company, specializes in yoshoku\u00a0Japanese-style Western cuisine.

The rich sauce features onion, garlic, ginger and curry powder. Ken Yamada, of Anzu restaurant in London, came here as a child with his parents. \u201cI love Japanese curry, and Shiseido Parlour\u2019s curry is as old school as it gets,\u201d he says. \u201cI went back recently and it was exactly the same.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanana Leaf ApoloThis casual restaurant on Race Course Road serves its curries on a banana leaf, rather than a plate. It\u2019s a favorite of British chef\u00a0Alun Sperring\u00a0of the Chilli\u00a0Pickle restaurant in Brighton, who enjoys the fish head curry. \u201cThis dish has become famous since the \u201960s when a South Indian restaurant owner offered it to entice the local Chinese clientele,\u201d he says. \u201cThe gravy features lots of tamarind, chili, onions, garlic, tomatoes, coriander, cumin, turmeric and fenugreek powder served with okra and aubergine and a side of steamed rice. It\u2019s delicious and as you work\u00a0through the large bowl of thin gravy expect a nice burn to build from within.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry Masala, MadridFrench chef Arnaud Bignon, who holds two Michelin stars at the Greenhouse restaurant in London, came across this restaurant in the center of Madrid. He particularly enjoyed palak\u00a0paneer, a dish of fresh spinach with paneer\u00a0cheese. \u201cIt had a perfect balance of richness and acidity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe paneer\u00a0was soft both in texture and in flavor but the spices really stood out in the spinach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGunpowder, LondonThis tiny restaurant near Spitalfields market is always packed with diners drawn by its big flavors and modest prices. The spicy venison and vermicelli donut is a favorite of Romy\u00a0Gill of Romy\u2019s Kitchen. The snack\u00a0features venison slow-cooked for 4 to 6 hours, flavored with curry leaves, ginger, chili and other spices. \u201cVenison can dry out, and it\u2019s difficult to get the spicing right,\u201d Gill says. \u201cHere, it is perfectly balanced: The flavors are subtle and the heat isn\u2019t overpowering.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYIIVLtlagy/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirch\u00a0Masala, Tooting, LondonThis casual restaurant in suburban Tooting has a large menu focused on spicy\u00a0karahi dishes cooked in a deep pan like a wok. Cinnamon Club\u2019s Singh is a regular and likes to order the Karela\u00a0gosht\u00a0mutton curry on the bone with\u00a0bitter melons.\u00a0\u201cFor\u00a0gutsy, spicy, rustic cooking from the Punjab, this is as good as it comes,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndian Accent, New YorkWill Bowlby of Kricket, in London, is a fan of this modern Indian restaurant in Le Parker Meridien in Midtown. It\u2019s an import from New Delhi, where this fine-dining establishment is the best Indian restaurant in the world, according to the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants awards.\u00a0\u201cThe standout dish was the pulled jackfruit phulka,\u201d Bowlby says. This soft bread is more normally served with pork, which is also available. \u201cThe consistency and flavor of the jackfruit emphasized again the fact that veg is often the way forward, especially when it comes to Indian food.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZGnXR5ARgF/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJunoon, New YorkThis Michelin-starred Midtown restaurant is a favorite of Gill. The\u00a0lal mirch\u00a0ka paneer\u00a0is a starter of house-made cheese, tandoori pepper coulis and confit peppers. \u201cPaneer\u00a0can be tasteless and rubbery,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is beautifully made and prepared. It melts in your mouth and the spicing is just right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZl0PywDS5S/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Vines is the chief food critic at Bloomberg.
