{"text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Bonds sold by Reliance Communications Ltd., the Indian mobile phone operator controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, plunged to a record low after the company missed an interest payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat marked the firm\u2019s first failure to pay a coupon on a note in the U.S. currency, as it battles for survival amid a shakeout in the world\u2019s second-largest telecom market.\u00a0With India\u2019s larger mobile players vying for market share, intensifying price competition has driven down earnings at Reliance Communications and other smaller carriers. Amid a wave of industry consolidation, the company\u2019s plan to merge with rival Aircel Ltd. collapsed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Reliance Communications\u2019 earnings slumped after deep-pocketed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., backed by India\u2019s richest man and Ambani\u2019s older brother, started offering free calls last year.\u00a0Years of over-spending are catching up with the company, which is struggling under a mountain of debt, and some bond investors had been anticipating the latest difficulties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cReliance Communications\u2019 high leverage and sector specific challenges have been well known to investors for a long time,\" said Dhiraj Bajaj, Singapore-based portfolio manager at Lombard Odier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of the\u00a0$300 million of 6.5 percent securities on which the carrier owed the interest payment slid 1.7 cents, to a record low of 39.4 cents, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications had net debt of 443.45 billion rupees, compared with cash and equivalents of 4.55 billion rupees as of March 31, according to its annual report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interest payment of about $9.75 million for Reliance Communications\u2019 notes maturing November 2020 was due on Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If the company fails to pay interest within seven days of the due date, an event of default would occur, according to a bond prospectus. The company is in a so-called standstill period with its lenders until December 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about Anil Ambani\u2019s lost decade of aborted phone-tower sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the time being, no payment of interest and/or principal is being made to any lenders and/or bondholders,\u201d the company wrote in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance Communications, whose customer base of about 75 million people is dwarfed by Idea Cellular Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd.,\u00a0announced plans last week to sell down assets and proposed converting\u00a070 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) of debt into equity. The embattled mobile operator has said it will cut back on its second-and third-generation wireless networks from Nov. 30 and also faces an insolvency petition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recovery value for offshore bondholders may not be too high, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecovery Prospects\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the banks go ahead with Reliance Communications\u2019 proposal and take a 51 percent stake in the company through the debt swap, and if bondholders are treated below other secured debt, then their recovery will be nil,\u00a0said Pavitra Sudhindran, credit analyst at Nomura.\u00a0 \u201cIf bondholders are treated pari passu with other secured debt, our base case recovery is 35 cents,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate reply to emailed questions to Reliance Communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough India\u2019s new bankruptcy laws have taken effect, analysts are skeptical as to how quickly investors can get their money back when payments are missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal recovery process in India can be \u201cvery arduous and slow,\u201d according to Charles Macgregor, head of emerging markets at Lucror Analytics Pte. in Singapore. Investors should be aware of this aspect of lending to Indian companies, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92017 Bloomberg L.P.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Reliance Communications Bonds Fall to Record on Missed Payment\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-11-14 03:13:00"}
