The 2016 upstart, called Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation's fourth largest operator by offering call services free for life and data transmission at dirt cheap rates.Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: One Indian Telecom Operator Allowed 31 Million Spam Calls In 2017, Says Truecaller\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028, within just a single decade.\u201cThe idea of Jio was first seeded by my daughter, Isha, in 2011. She was a student at Yale (in the U.S.) and was home for holidays. She wanted to submit some coursework \u2013 and she said, 'Dad, the internet in our house sucks,\u201d he recalled.Ambani said Isha\u2019s twin brother, Akash, at that time, stated that in the old world, telecom was a voice and people made money on calls, but in the new world, everything is digital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsha and Akash belong to India\u2019s young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind.Mukesh Ambani, Chairman At Reliance Industries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia at the time was suffering from poor connectivity and a severe scarcity of the most critical digital resource \u2013 data. Data was not only scarce, but it was priced artificially high to make it unaffordable to a majority of Indians, he said.Jio transformed all of this by making data abundant and affordable and available in every part of the country.\u201cWe launched Jio in September 2016. And today Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: India Allows Telecom Firms More Time to Pay Spectrum Dues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbani said while the United States pioneered 1G mobile network, Europe ushered in 2G, and China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio has created the largest greenfield 4G LTE-only data network in the world.\u201cThis will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took the combined Indian telecom industry 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. Jio took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. And it is also 5G-ready today.\u201d Jio has made voice-calling free for life and has also made high-quality data available at the lowest price in the world - at almost one-tenth the prices in the US, he said, and the firm acquired more than 100 million customers in just 170 days of launch.This was more than one-and-a-half times the population of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Reliance Jio Is Now India\u2019s Third-Largest Telecom Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the 500 million Indians still using a feature phone and not a smartphone, Jio brought out the \u201cworld's most affordable 4G LTE smartphone\u201d that is available for free for use with a deposit of Rs 1,500, he said. \u201cThe result has been stunning: 3 lakh to 5 lakh Indians are daily migrating to Jio Phone. And for the same Rs 200-300, they benefit through access to the high-speed internet with their existing voice needs are completely free.\u201d As the internet becomes accessible to all Indians, the country will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Cabinet Approves Relief Package For Telecom Sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWithin the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe's population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,\u201d he said, adding that because of Jio, India has jumped from the rank of 155 to number one in the world in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years.\u201cJio has already grown to be the biggest start-up in India's history,\u201d he said.The previous honorees for the 'Drivers of Change' award include DeepMind Technologies (2016), FANUC (2015), HBO (2014), Alibaba (2013), MONDRAGON Corporation (2012), Amazon (2011), Apple (2010), Fiat (2009) and Ryanair (2008). RIL won it for its \"exceptional commitment to innovation-led, exponential growth within the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services.Stating that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original \u2018Driver of Change\u2019 in India's business history, he said the legendary industrialist founded RIL in 1966 with a meagre capital of Rs 1,000 (about $130 at that time).RIL, which today is an over $50 billion group, has doubled shareholder money every two-and-half years since its initial public offering in 1977, he said. \u201cDuring the same period, Reliance has contributed more to India's national wealth than any other business group.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Government Wants State-Owned Telecom Units To Collaborate More\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Mukesh Ambani Says His Daughter Isha Seeded Reliance Jio In 2011\n      \n\n", "time": "2018-03-16 09:17:00"}
