{"text": "\n\n\n\nEssential services such as banking and transport are likely to be hit today as 10 central trade unions go on one-day nationwide strike, protesting against \u201canti-worker\u201d changes in labour laws and the Centre\u2019s \u201cindifference\u201d to their demands for better wages. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe strike is on. We are getting good response. More information will pour in after sometime. Around 90 percent workers at BHEL\u2019s plant in Tiruchirapalli have not reported at work in the morning shift.\n\nTapan Kumar Sen, General Secretary, Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe further said, \u201cVizag steel plant is 100 percent closed. At some places there would be instances of \u2018Rail Roko\u2019. This is going to be a successful strike as more than 15 crore workers will come on streets to protest.\u201d Last year, these 10 trade unions had called nationwide strike and around 15 crore workers participated in the agitation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGurgaon industrial area is completely closed and the police have arrested about 12 people in Manesar area. All this information indicates that the strike will be bigger this time.\n\nTapan Kumar Sen, General Secretary, Centre for Indian Trade Unions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll major unions, excluding RSS-associated BMS (Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh), have joined the strike call, terming the government\u2019s assurances to look into their demands and the recent announcements for two-year bonus and hike in minimum wage as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d. On its part, the government has asked all ministries to ensure that public utilities and essential services are not affected. Secretaries of all departments have been asked to take effective measures for smooth running of various services coming under their respective ministries. Yesterday, speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya blamed the previous UPA regime for the issues faced by the workers and said the present government \u201cdoesn\u2019t want a confrontation with labour unions\u201d and rather needs their cooperation and support.\nHe had conceded banking and insurance sectors are likely to be impacted more due to the strike today, while adding that out of 12 demands of the trade unions, eight are related to the labour department and seven of them have been agreed to.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        Strike By 10 Trade Unions Begins; Transport, Banking To Be Hit\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-09-02 08:11:00"}
