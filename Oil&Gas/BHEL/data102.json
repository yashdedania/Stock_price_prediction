{"text": "\n\n\n\nL&T without AM Naik is as tough to imagine as AM Naik without L&T.In October 2017, Naik, the executive chairman of Indian engineering giant Larsen & Toubro Ltd. will retire after 14 years in the job and 52 years at the company.Naik joined L&T as a junior engineer in 1965, says the company\u2019s website. He rose to general manager, then managing director and chief executive officer and added chairman to the clutch of titles in December 2003. In April 2012 he was also appointed group executive chairman. Under his chairmanship the company\u2019s revenue has grown from Rs 10,000 crore to over Rs 1 lakh crore. Also to his credit is L&T\u2019s diversification into information technology and financial services.Naik has been grooming his successor, SN Subrahmanyan, for almost two years now. Currently Subrahmanyan serves as deputy managing director and president and will take over as chief executive officer later in the year.It\u2019s not yet known who will be the next chairman, executive or otherwise. Before the interview to BloombergQuint, Naik, when asked if he would consider staying on as non-executive chairman, said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be non-executive anything\u201d, insisting he prefers a clean break. But he\u2019s open to the idea of running the L&T Employees Welfare Foundation, a trust which owns a little over 12 percent of the company\u2019s shares. The Foundation serves as somewhat of a defense against hostile takeovers, L&T has seen three in just the past three decades. But the only real safeguard according to Naik is \u201can expensive share price\u201d - a maxim he often repeats.At 26 times one year forward earnings, the L&T stock is priced at a substantial premium to Asian peer group companies (7 - 17 times), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That should serve as some comfort to Naik, at a time when the Indian economy isn\u2019t doing much for his company\u2019s growth prospects. In this interview Naik discusses expanding to new geographies, the outlook for power, hydrocarbon and defense businesses and how financial year 2017-18 will shape up. The first in half a century sans AM Naik.\n\n\n\n", "ticker": "BM", "title": "\n\n\n        The Prospects For L&T; In A Year Without AM Naik\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-02-13 04:44:00"}
