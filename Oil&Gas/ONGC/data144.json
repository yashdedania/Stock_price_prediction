{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- India has set a one-month deadline to begin implementing steps to resolve a dispute over natural gas that migrated from Oil & Natural Corp.\u2019s offshore block in the Bay of Bengal to the adjoining assets of Reliance Industries Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Wednesday that a government\u00a0panel has endorsed findings by an outside consultant that studied how some gas produced from Reliance\u2019s KG-D6 block had come from ONGC\u2019s adjacent KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off India\u2019s east coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliance and ONGC didn\u2019t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government set up in December a one-member panel headed by Ajit Prakash Shah, a former chief justice of Delhi High Court,\u00a0to determine whether ONGC should be compensated, and by how much. He was asked to examine an independent study\u00a0done by DeGolyer & MacNaughton, a petroleum industry consultant, on the reservoirs in exploration blocks held by ONGC and Reliance Industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJustice Shah has given a comprehensive report, everything is there in the report,\" Pradhan said. Shah \u201clooked into the economic and legal implications of gas migration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report suggests a future course of action, Shah told reporters at a briefing with the minister on Wednesday, declining to provide details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC, the country\u2019s biggest producer, sued Reliance Industries in May 2015, claiming the company had drawn a \u201csubstantial\u201d volume of natural gas from the block. Production from Reliance\u2019s KG-D6 block has slumped to about 8.7 million cubic meters a day from more than 60 million in 2010. Reliance says the reservoir has proved to be more difficult that it had expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        India Sets 1-Month Deadline to Tackle ONGC-Reliance Gas Dispute\n      \n\n", "time": "2016-09-01 02:16:00"}
