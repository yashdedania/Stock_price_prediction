{"ticker": "BM", "text": "\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s biggest oil explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd., will buy out the government\u2019s 51 percent stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Both the state-owned companies are public listed entities yet the transaction will not be accompanied by the mandatory open offer to HPCL\u2019s public shareholders.This was confirmed by the ONGC chairman DK Sarraf in an interview to BloombergQuint.BQ: One big question which has been asked is about the open offer. Since you will acquire more than 25 percent in HPCL, will it trigger an open offer?Sarraf: My understanding of the law is that it cannot.But not all lawyers BloombergQuint spoke to agree with Sarraf\u2019s understanding of the law.Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019s Takeover Regulations require that in matters of change in control or the acquisition of 25 percent or more voting right, the acquirer must give public shareholders of the target company the opportunity to exit by tendering their shares in an open offer. The minimum size of the open offer must be 26 percent.\u201cIt will be argued that directly or indirectly, ONGC and HPCL are government companies and the acquisition will not result in change in management and therefore there is no need for an open offer,\u201d said Mohit Saraf, senior partner at law firm Luthra & Luthra.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        ONGC-HPCL Deal: Can The Government Get Away With Avoiding An Open Offer?\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-07-20 09:35:00"}
