ONGC had a cash of Rs 16,648 crore, and a total debt of Rs 55,682 crore as of March 31, 2017.Buying the government's stake will only add debt, said the international brokerage house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transaction will have no impact on operations of HPCL, but ONGC will see a notable increase in debt for purchase of the government\u2019s stake.\n\nCLSA\u2019s Sector Outlook On Oil And Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read: Pros And Cons Of ONGC Acquiring Government Stake In HPCL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is planning to sell its stake in HPCL to the country\u2019s biggest explorer, Bloomberg had reported citing people familiar with the matter. The government plans to create an energy giant which could compete with international rivals, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in his Budget speech. It would be possible through mergers and consolidation, he had said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nONGC could also sell its stake in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) to fund the HPCL buyout, according to CLSA. The upstream company holds 13.8 percent stake in IOC, which is also the country\u2019s largest oil marketing company. The stake sale could fund the entire buyout, based on Monday\u2019s closing price of Rs 423.7. The sale will impact IOCL\u2019s share price though, added the brokerage house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If IOCL\u2019s stake is sold, it will limit any incremental value leakage and minimise net negative value impact on ONGC.\n\nCLSA\u2019s Sector Outlook On Oil And Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore May Follow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ONGC-HPCL deal may just be the first of more to come, said CLSA which expects the government to monetise other cross-holdings in the energy space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIOCL could be the next big company which may be asked to acquire the smaller Oil India under this plan of achieving integration.\n\nCLSA\u2019s Sector Outlook On Oil And Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf ONGC does acquire HPCL, it will also help the government meet more than a third of its divestment target of Rs 72,500 crore (at current market prices) for the ongoing financial year while retaining control over the oil companies.ONGC will become the country\u2019s third largest refiner after IOC and Reliance Industries Ltd. The upstream company owns Mangalore Refineries & Petrochemicals Ltd. which has an installed capacity of 15 million tonnes a year.\n\n\n\n", "title": "\n\n\n        Government Will Be Sole Gainer If ONGC Takes Over HPCL, Says CLSA\n      \n\n", "time": "2017-06-13 07:48:00"}
